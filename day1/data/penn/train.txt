 many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable 
 they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s

 where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits

 the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c 
 for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate

 chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing 
 still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs 
 these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says 
 some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte

 the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have 
 in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N 
 but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening 
 to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker 
 we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away 
 mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk> 
 the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners 
 <unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration 
 proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells 
 then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking 
 ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk> 
 a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved 
 no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling 
 totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls 
 far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position 
 skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change 
 in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk> 
 ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers 
 when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below 
 with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services 
 but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk> 
 so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says 
 vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself 
 the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president 
 says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience 
 also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk> 
 one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women 
 another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk> 
 investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks 
 in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over 
 strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk> 
 indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk> 
 in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before 
 the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year 
 meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices 
 as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards 
 put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say 
 some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N 
 a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price 
 there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data 
 still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past 
 in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically 
 so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength 
 painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year 
 the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken 
 dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs 
 those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures 
 one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends 
 in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels 
 but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much 
 having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says 
 with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels

 the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better said john <unk> a food industry analyst for prudential-bache in new york 
 some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of campbell shares in recent months 
 mr. baum a <unk> marketer who is said to have a good <unk> with campbell employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <unk> farm unit 
 mr. harper a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in N will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <unk> 
 mr. mcgovern N had been under intense pressure from the board to boost campbell 's <unk> performance to the level of other food companies

 mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of N in october N unless i get fired

 a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that mr. bernstein may have <unk> with <unk> newhouse jr. whose family company advance publications inc. owns random house 
 in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure <unk> out of discussions with <unk> newhouse and that 's the decision i reached 
 mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. N and work with his successor who is to be named soon

 the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ N million from $ N million during mr. bernstein 's tenure 
 mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett <unk> has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in N 
 when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator

 congress learned during the reagan administration that it could <unk> the executive branch by <unk> again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent 
 the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law 
 the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an <unk> veto over every <unk> action of the president through the ability to <unk> funding 
 as <unk> of congressional power understand a power of the <unk> so broadly <unk> would <unk> the presidency and <unk> the principle of separation of powers 
 the N appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii

 thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress <unk> the president 's power to make <unk> appointments under article ii 
 the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> act prohibits voluntary service to the government 
 the N appropriations bills also contain a number of <unk> provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution 
 <unk> provisions which might be called <unk> laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress 
 typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from <unk> into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more <unk> alternatives to regulations 
 there is something <unk> suspect about congress 's <unk> the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other 
 president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives 
 <unk> of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and <unk> under article ii would be different from the line-item veto 
 there is no downside if the president asserts a right of <unk> over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal N appropriations bills 
 if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win 
 if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. <unk> was for the reagan administration 
 as it stands now congress <unk> after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down 
 his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year 
 despite one of the most devastating <unk> on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ N billion last year 
 with prices soaring they were able to sell the <unk> commodities at considerable profit the agency 's <unk> report said 
 in less <unk> areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production <unk> greatly from the higher prices 
 to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the <unk> states including indiana illinois nebraska and the <unk> 
 last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s 
 it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <unk> and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the N farm program next year 
 at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst 
 despite federal disaster relief the drought of N was a severe financial setback for an estimated N to N farmers according to the department 
 indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline 
 last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ N billion from a record $ N billion in N 
 after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper 
 an attempted buy-out led by john j. <unk> chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as <unk> and <unk> had filed through since 
 further the herald seemed torn <unk> between keeping its <unk> hearst <unk> blue-collar and <unk> and trying to provide a <unk> upscale alternative to the sometimes <unk> times 
 the herald joins the baltimore <unk> which <unk> and the boston <unk> which was sold as <unk> of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s 
 many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history 
 actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy 
 founded as the examiner in N by mr. hearst the herald was <unk> by a bitter <unk> strike that began in N and cut circulation in half 
 for example the herald consistently beat its <unk> rival on disclosures about los angeles mayor tom bradley 's financial dealings 
 i 've never seen so many people <unk> in one place at one time said bill johnson an assistant city editor 
 outside a young <unk> filling a news box with an extra edition <unk> herald examiner closes refused to take a reader 's quarter 
 olympia broadcasting corp. said it did n't make a $ N million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ N million of senior subordinated debentures 
 the <unk> owner and <unk> said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions 
 it said it needs to make the payment by dec. N to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt 
 in september the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business 
 the companies are giving four-day <unk> for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card 
 they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. N and will end dec. N to about five million card holders 
 buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments says a spokeswoman for the division 
 buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor 's car a product for upscale professionals 
 to that end american express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card 
 many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american express card but few card holders realize this mr. <unk> says 
 but gmac approved the buick program he says because the american express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates 
 mr. <unk> says american express considers gm and buick very sophisticated direct-mail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability 
 gmac <unk> the <unk> list for holders more than N years old with household incomes over $ N who had n't missed any payments the buick spokeswoman says 
 these N million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which start at N N for two-year loan contracts 
 <unk> are chicago <unk> las vegas nev. los angeles miami beach fla. new orleans new york <unk> fla. san francisco and washington d.c. 
 a buyer who chooses to fly to his <unk> must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on united airlines 
 in <unk> of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a <unk> <unk> or a stereo videocassette recorder 
 card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a <unk> with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes 
 a few years ago the company offered two <unk> tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its <unk> luxury car 
 the promotion helped <unk> sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than N N buick said at the time 
 the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks 
 the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of <unk> and <unk> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions 
 as many as N u.k. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities 
 in response to the ruling <unk> futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session 
 <unk> or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially <unk> some of the losses to end about N point lower 
 the council which is alleged to have engaged in over N deals valued at over # N billion $ N billion lost millions of pounds from <unk> swap deals 
 at one point <unk> is reported to have accounted for as much as N N of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings 
 in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks which would make fixed-rate payments 
 while this court ruling was only on <unk> it will obviously be very <unk> in other cases of a similar nature a <unk> representing one of the banks said 
 other financial institutions involved include barclays bank plc midland bank plc security pacific corp. chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international 
 if the banks <unk> all <unk> of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the <unk> ruling work both ways some market sources said 
 officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable 
 program trading itself according to many <unk> who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace 
 the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. N though it may have <unk> it 
 so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully <unk> public and congressional opinion to <unk> their <unk> 
 the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very <unk> is at stake 
 some such as traditional money manager neuberger & <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers <unk> on wall street 
 charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is <unk> other <unk> to the <unk> trading cause says he has received <unk> letters offering support 
 even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be <unk> that the future belongs with the new guard 
 last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered 
 i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino mr. bradley wrote 
 the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal <unk> and <unk> employee against employee 
 at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away 
 corporations like contel <unk> program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders 
 the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives 
 but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading 
 for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of <unk> program trading 
 such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds 
 to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find 
 the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics <unk> to <unk> 
 if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd <unk> mutual funds and pension funds says larry <unk> managing partner at neuberger & <unk> 
 i have not seen one <unk> of evidence to support restrictions on program trading says a <unk> university finance professor <unk> stoll an authority on the subject 
 the oct. N plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the <unk> of the $ N billion buy-out of ual corp 
 while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible 
 susan del <unk> head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring the role the takeover stock <unk> is taking in the market as a source of volatility 
 like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the <unk> have been losing out on <unk> of it to the new guard in recent years 
 traditional stock managers like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors 
 yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard <unk> like the s&p 
 not surprisingly <unk> money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to <unk> portfolios so they mirror the s&p N 
 the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make <unk> of the N big board <unk> firms 
 when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the big board trading floor says one specialist there 
 the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends 
 they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then 
 oh you 're in the paper business is one reaction mr. <unk> says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders 
 by this september program traders were doing a record N N of the big board 's average daily trading volume 
 among the top practitioners were wall street blue <unk> morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc 
 wall street 's cash <unk> has been <unk> but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem 
 for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in N and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched 
 now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock 
 program traders ' power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat 
 many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the <unk> back in the bottle 
 the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say 
 currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative 
 the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price 
 but in N program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets 
 program traders argue that a <unk> of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets 
 big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild <unk> swings 
 in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york 
 to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p N widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p N widget in chicago 
 by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between N N and N N to the annual return of the s&p N 
 that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective 
 the fact that a vast majority of <unk> money managers fail to beat the s&p N may contribute to the <unk> surrounding the issue 
 the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' <unk> to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares 
 an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs 
 think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p N stocks usually it is large investors <unk> a buy or sell in chicago 
 the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in <unk> to make widget prices move 
 perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade 
 volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity 
 the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not <unk> 
 policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are <unk> to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away 
 the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term 
 in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today 
 periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were <unk> change N N and N for example 
 it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers <unk> <unk> on program trading when the markets decline while <unk> the great values still <unk> as the markets rise 
 could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil <unk> of program-trading <unk> 
 in using program trading as a <unk> boy <unk> investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing <unk> products 
 this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <unk> program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms <unk> the cause 
 they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance 
 yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert <unk> <unk> press <unk> on each company he follows 
 almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences 
 if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors 
 <unk> index funds just are n't <unk> enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay 
 each new trading <unk> is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their <unk> clients here or overseas 
 left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably 
 spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit 
 as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ N million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N which began oct. N 
 some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts 
 but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them 
 under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ N million for the antitrust division would be cut $ N million 
 the ftc budget request of $ N million about $ N million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ N million 
 the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N as was appropriated in fiscal N 
 under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ N million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions 
 but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could <unk> merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected 
 today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen mr. edwards argued 
 any money in excess of $ N million collected from the fees in fiscal N would go to the treasury at large 
 though some lawyers reported that prospective <unk> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings

 the finding marks a significant step in research on bulk superconductors which are aimed at use in wires for motors <unk> <unk> and other applications 
 scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry 
 a family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised 
 but it wo n't lead to imminent use of new superconductors cautioned robert b. van dover one of the at&t researchers 
 he added that the current-carrying capacity of <unk> samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals

 the reason risks from the firms ' new merchant banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business <unk>

 securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short-term corporate <unk> which they sell to finance their daily operations

 standard & poor 's corp. says first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc. in particular are likely to have difficulty <unk> up their credit standing in months ahead 
 what worries <unk> concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings 
 merchant banking where firms commit their own money is getting riskier and there 's less of it to go around 
 in addition he says the buy-out business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings <unk> 
 it said that the temptation for <unk> to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor 
 in addition shearson 's listed $ N billion of capital is <unk> according to the rating concerns because it includes $ N billion of goodwill 
 drexel meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating 
 the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held drexel the leading underwriter in that market 
 the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six <unk> related to a big insider-trading scandal 
 drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm 's <unk> almost in half to just over N 
 recently drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years

 the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some N pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels 
 the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used 
 drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used 
 just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different <unk> 
 despite the supreme court 's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and <unk> <unk> from the defendants 
 the big problem however is that there 's no guarantee that this <unk> will be limited to des or to drugs 
 the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining <unk> drug <unk> off the u.s. market 
 as liability expert peter <unk> tells us after the <unk> case if any drug maker <unk> an <unk> drug it 's time to sell that company 's stock short 
 des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts 
 but a N law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's <unk> with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation 
 everyone by now understands that congress is utterly <unk> of writing legislation to help <unk> people without its becoming some billion-dollar <unk> 
 we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des cases 
 they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know it wo n't be done by congress

 jaguar was shocked by mr. ridley 's decision because management had believed the government would n't lift the golden share without consulting the company first

 the soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks then argued for <unk> some N russian planes because they are solely defensive 
 the dispute over that issue according to one u.s. official is a potential treaty <unk> and only president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev may be able to resolve it 
 greece and turkey for example are suspected of <unk> their <unk> in hopes that they can emerge from the <unk> treaty with large remaining forces to deter each other 
 it 's just going to be sloppy both on our side and theirs the warsaw pact 's says one nato analyst 
 so far neither the bush administration nor arms-control experts in congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to <unk> out than president bush has allowed 
 they argue that the bigger danger would be that the west would delay action so long that the soviets might back away from the current <unk> attitude

 in the price range it 's a <unk> <unk> product said <unk> <unk> an analyst at the <unk> firm <unk> 
 the machine is part of an effort by mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers not just of <unk> technology 
 mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional risc applications such as engineering mips said the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications 
 this clearly demonstrates that mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company said mips vice president john <unk> 
 for mips which expects revenue of $ N million this year <unk> allies such as control data are essential to attract software developers to the company 's risc architecture 
 the thing it says about mips is that they 're on a roll right now said ms. <unk> at <unk>

 another fight is brewing between congress and the bush administration over how to pay for the savings-and-loan bailout without adding to the federal budget deficit 
 officials of the resolution trust corp. have said privately that such a plan was the most likely alternative to raise short-term cash for the bailout 
 instead the <unk> and the congressional budget office said the rtc should consider using treasury debt which is less expensive and subject to oversight by congress 
 the rtc has projected that it will require between $ N billion to $ N billion in temporary working capital 
 the new s&l law allows the rtc to issue notes for as much as N N of the value of the assets it holds 
 but higher interest rates paid on <unk> debt could add billions to the bailout costs and would n't be subject to congressional scrutiny ways and means members argued 
 the new s&l bailout law allows $ N billion to be spent to sell or merge sick s&ls and their assets but that is a net cost 
 in the meantime the agency must raise cash to maintain assets such as real estate until they can be sold 
 if working capital financing is not provided he said the rtc may have to slow s&l sales or dump acquired assets through fire sales

 an increasing number of big japanese investors are buying up u.s. home mortgages that have been <unk> and packaged for sale as <unk> instruments known as mortgage-backed securities 
 that may not come as a surprise to americans who have watched the japanese <unk> up properties in the u.s. from golf courses to a stake in rockefeller center 
 but it marks a big change for the japanese who <unk> mortgage securities after getting burned by a big downturn in interest rates a few years back 
 the steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the u.s. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here 
 earlier this year blackstone group a new york investment bank had no trouble selling out a special $ N million <unk> trust it created for japanese investors 
 last year there were only several big investors who were interested says <unk> <unk> a vice president at the international arm of nomura securities co 
 at the moment nomura is the only japanese institution authorized to act as a primary seller of fannie mae instruments 
 the secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $ N billion or nearly half of the $ N trillion in u.s. residential mortgages issued 
 but there is a risk which the japanese discovered when they first dipped their <unk> into the market nearly five years ago 
 since most mortgages can be prepaid or <unk> at any time issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity 
 that 's a <unk> for long-term investors since it forces them to reinvest their money usually at lower rates than the original mortgage securities carried 
 two or three years ago the problem was that people did n't understand the prepayment risk says nomura 's mr. <unk> 
 <unk> the trouble to japanese investors mortgage securities pay interest monthly since most mortgages require homeowners to make monthly payments 
 but japanese institutional investors are used to quarterly or semiannual payments on their investments so the monthly cash flow posed administrative problems 
 and japanese investors took up nearly all of two $ N million real estate mortgage investment <unk> a kind of collateralized mortgage obligation that were offered to foreigners this year 
 in addition further packaging of mortgage-backed securities such as blackstone 's fund have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions do n't have to 
 freddie mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it wo n't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments

 therefore the debate about poison pills will continue to rage in the <unk> of corporations and the halls of <unk> 
 however these discount purchase rights may generally be redeemed at a nominal cost by the corporation 's directors if they approve of a bidder 
 recent studies by <unk> & co. conclude that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater <unk> appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years 
 critics of poison pills argue that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by <unk> premium bids from ever being made to shareholders 
 these critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run but also over longer periods 
 does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values and does this strategy require <unk> over an extended period 
 will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy 
 if the answers to these questions are <unk> then institutional investors are likely to be <unk> <unk> toward a specific poison pill 
 the limit could range from three years to seven years depending on the <unk> of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan 
 one rare example of a <unk> poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from texaco 
 pennzoil 's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner 
 the state of wisconsin investment board which owned about N N of the company 's voting stock worked with management to devise a <unk> poison pill 
 more widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team 's strategy 
 such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more <unk> dialogue between management and shareholders than the <unk> debate about poison pills

 in particular they <unk> the timing coming as it does on the heels of sony corp. 's controversial purchase of columbia pictures entertainment inc 
 during the past year government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged japanese companies to <unk> from flashy real estate purchases in the 
 altogether annual japanese investment in u.s. commercial real estate grew from about $ N billion in N to about $ N billion in N 
 many japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country 's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties 
 critics say mitsubishi estate 's decision to buy into rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are <unk> by the pressure to act for the good of japan 
 first of all it is a friendly acquisition in which rockefeller sought out mitsubishi estate and asked it to buy a majority share 
 <unk> the two companies found a similarity in their business and development <unk> and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications 
 we 'll continue to work with them in keeping with the reputation of the company and we 'll rely very much on their leadership says mitsubishi estate president <unk> <unk>

 japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification says <unk> <unk> an industry analyst at goldman sachs japan corp 
 rockefeller is n't the first overseas purchase for mitsubishi estate it has already played a leading role in designing los angeles 's citicorp plaza

 instead sony is likely to agree to let warner participate in certain of its businesses such as the record club of sony 's cbs records unit 
 warner has <unk> sony as the largest record company but it does n't have a powerful world-wide record club like cbs 
 still it may be tough for the two to have a smooth partnership in anything in the wake of sworn affidavits filed over the last week 
 one for example came from cbs records chairman walter yetnikoff who will head a committee that will oversee sony 's entertainment division including both records and movies 
 mr. ross also said he enjoys warm professional and personal relationships with japanese executives including sony chairman <unk> <unk> who has visited my home here 
 talks between the two sides could <unk> of course as they have more than once since sony announced its plans to hire mr. guber and mr. peters 
 any settlement is also expected to exclude mr. guber and mr. peters from any of the projects they were working on at warner 
 the guber-peters duo have N projects in various stages of development and production at warner including <unk> of the <unk> and a bright <unk> lie 
 once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development producers are typically free to take it elsewhere 
 mr. guber and mr. peters also almost certainly would n't be able to participate in future <unk> to batman the blockbuster hit they produced for warner 
 southern co. 's gulf power co. subsidiary pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy to make illegal political contributions and tax evasion and paid $ N in fines

 it is still common to read in the press that the church has N or more full-time american members and N associates 
 mr. moon 's support for a <unk> richard nixon the <unk> scandal and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church 's <unk> efforts 
 that the membership number has even kept close to its N size is the result of the <unk> of the church

 one group of <unk> manufacturing men from the company 's <unk> plant outside tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city 
 but when they arrived at the door all were afraid to go in <unk> that they would be out of place 
 he liked the <unk> lobby display of honda 's cars and trucks so much that he had nissan 's gloomy lobby exhibit <unk> 
 such sudden cultural shifts may come across as a bit forced but they seem to be genuine so much so in fact that some older employees have resisted 
 nissan handled the <unk> in a typically japanese fashion they were n't fired but instead were neglected says <unk> <unk> the personnel manager at the nissan technical center 
 the <unk> <unk> costs as much as $ N and is <unk> off against the <unk> N which begins at $ N 
 one is the <unk> a tiny <unk> with a <unk> <unk> top and <unk> <unk> that give it a <unk> look 
 nissan initially planned to sell just N <unk> but sales have passed N and there 's a one-year waiting list for the car 
 the chairs are <unk> seats and a gift shop sells such items as alarm <unk> <unk> like the <unk> 's <unk> <unk> 
 all these vehicles have sharply improved nissan 's morale and image but have n't done much for its market share 
 nissan had N N of the japanese car market in N before beginning a <unk> <unk> slide that continued through last year 
 nissan concedes that it wo n't recoup all its market-share losses in japan until at least N and even that timetable might prove optimistic 
 everyone else is going to catch up with nissan 's innovative designs says a. <unk> <unk> auto analyst at first boston japan ltd 
 nissan 's pace of <unk> hits will slow he adds just as <unk> toyota <unk> its own batch of new cars 
 likewise in the u.s. nissan has grabbed N N of the car market so far this year up from N N a year ago 
 but even that brings nissan only to the share it had in N and leaves the company behind its high of N N in N and N 
 nissan 's risk is that its <unk> strategy might get lost amid the highly publicized rebates being offered by detroit 's big three 
 even if the new stanza succeeds nissan will remain behind in the <unk> segment where its <unk> does n't measure up to the honda civic and toyota <unk> 
 the ads have generated some <unk> but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other u.s. auto advertising 
 but on reflection mr. <unk> says he concluded that nissan is being prudent in following its <unk> strategy instead of simply copying lexus 
 infiniti is nissan 's big business move for the <unk> century and we 're in no hurry to generate large profits right away mr. <unk> says 
 despite plans to add two new infiniti models next year bringing the total to four infiniti wo n't show profits for at least five years he adds 
 nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in japanese car sales 
 but nissan expects to earn only N billion yen in the current fiscal year a modest increase of N N 
 in its last fiscal year nissan 's profit represented just N N of sales compared with N N at toyota 
 nissan is the world 's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world 's key economic <unk> the u.s. japan and europe 
 that gives it an <unk> strategic advantage at least until its rivals catch up but also plenty of <unk> headaches 
 for example nissan 's u.s. operations include N separate subsidiaries for manufacturing sales design research etc. that report separately back to japan 
 and in july nissan 's tennessee manufacturing plant beat back a united auto workers organizing effort with aggressive tactics that have left some workers bitter 
 we are in a <unk> phase from being a japanese company to becoming an international company based in japan says mr. <unk> the executive vice president 
 he promises that nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all u.s. operations just as it 's doing in europe 
 perhaps the biggest challenge however will be to prevent a return to its former corporate <unk> as its recovery continues

 president bush and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will hold an informal meeting in early december a move that should give both leaders a political boost at home 
 the white house is <unk> not calling the meeting a summit so that there wo n't be any expectation of detailed negotiations or agreements 
 the two leaders will meet on dec. N and N <unk> the two days of meetings between a u.s. and a soviet naval vessel in the <unk> sea 
 the unusual <unk> meeting wo n't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed 
 in announcing the meeting yesterday mr. bush told reporters at the white house that neither he nor mr. gorbachev expects any substantial decisions or agreements 
 instead he said that the purpose is simply for the two to get better <unk> and discuss a wide range of issues without a formal agenda 
 despite the informal nature of the session and the calculated effort to hold down expectations the meeting could pay significant political dividends for both leaders 
 american officials have said that a meeting with the leader of the u.s. could help bolster his <unk> among soviet politicians and <unk> whose support he needs 
 he recently told a small group of american businessmen in moscow that he hoped to sign a general trade agreement with the u.s. possibly at the N summit 
 the soviets hope a trade agreement would give them <unk> nation status which would lower the tariffs on soviet exports to the u.s. 
 but one bush administration official knowledgeable about the summit plan cautioned against assuming that there will be bold new initiatives on the soviet economy or other issues 
 do n't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation or arms control or the environment he said 
 aside from the soviet economic plight and talks on cutting strategic and chemical arms one other issue the soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions 
 that meeting sent <unk> through the western alliance because mr. reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting american allies 
 mr. bush said that he initiated talks with the soviets on the informal meeting by sending a proposal to mr. gorbachev last july which the soviet leader readily accepted 
 indeed many senior officials had been insisting for weeks that mr. bush was n't interested in such an informal <unk> 
 while flying home from those discussions mr. bush drafted a letter to mr. gorbachev suggesting an informal <unk> to <unk> their formal summit next year 
 bnl previously reported that its georgia branch had taken on loan commitments <unk> $ N billion without the <unk> management 's approval

 hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging <unk> protesters from some building or <unk> in one of our cities 
 maybe he did n't start it but <unk> gandhi certainly provided a <unk> beginning to non-violent civil disobedience as we know it today 
 it is difficult however to justify civil disobedience non-violent or not where citizens have full <unk> to the ballot box to effect change 
 there may be a few cases where the law breaking is well <unk> and so completely <unk> of the rights of others that it is difficult to <unk> it 
 the case of <unk> parks the black woman who refused to sit at the back of the bus comes to mind as an illustration 
 the subject of this discussion is non-violent civil disobedience but before we get on with that let me make just a few <unk> remarks about <unk> demonstrations 
 they are useful to call public attention to <unk> but they have little value in <unk> anyone about the issues in dispute 
 the <unk> of television in dramatic confrontation encourages <unk> of <unk> <unk> through <unk> <unk> gestures <unk> signs and other <unk> inspired tactics 
 <unk> <unk> and an environment where compromise can begin are lost in a hostile posture <unk> by <unk> media interviews 
 at best demonstrations are <unk> and <unk> <unk> at worst they can become the <unk> that lead to law breaking 
 demonstrations are particularly apt to <unk> into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the <unk> and become mobile 
 where non-violent civil disobedience is the centerpiece rather than a <unk> demonstration that may only attract crime it is difficult to justify 
 the demonstration was non-violent and involved only a simple <unk> but its impact on that individual was violent and terminal 
 the demonstrators have been non-violent but the result of their <unk> has been to seriously <unk> the rights of others <unk> with their dispute 
 let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that only <unk> other people indirectly yet does <unk> damage to the nation as a whole 
 even more at fault are those leaders in and out of government who urged and supported their <unk> thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy <unk> 
 it is amazing that the <unk> mass executions in vietnam and cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally <unk> 
 worse it remained to a <unk> but <unk> president of the united states to <unk> the final <unk> upon those who fought and died in vietnam 
 under the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the nation president carter <unk> thousands of draft <unk> thus giving dignity to their allegations of the war 's <unk> 
 finally i think it important to point out the extraordinarily high <unk> of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage 
 here is a good rule of <unk> if the movement produced the leader the chance that he is <unk> is much greater than if the leader produced the movement 
 in either case ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by watching the act of civil disobedience 
 if you have not it is probable that a <unk> airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course 
 the tax increase on top of the current <unk> per dollar sales tax would become effective this dec. N and expire dec. N N

 the consumer-products and newsprint company said net rose to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 after a flat second quarter tied largely to lower newsprint earnings <unk> attributed the gain to improved results in its consumer businesses in north america brazil and korea 
 those gains came from higher prices particularly for disposable <unk> and tissue products and from increased sales primarily for <unk> products the company said 
 the <unk> comparison was also enhanced by charges taken in the year-earlier period including $ N million related to the modernization of a pulp and newsprint mill in alabama 
 in the first nine months profit rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 the agents will make more than routine inquiries about such items as <unk> status and dependents they want to look at living standards and business assets 
 but they also are to see that taxpayers get all <unk> tax benefits and to ask if <unk> who sought irs aid were satisfied with it 
 courts have ruled that taxpayers must submit to <unk> audits but the irs will excuse from the <unk> <unk> anyone who was <unk> without change for either N or N 
 <unk> proposals to <unk> the more than N civil penalties and make them <unk> and easier to <unk> are in the house tax bill 
 but they were stripped from the senate bill after staffers estimated penalty revenue would fall by $ N million over five years 
 still congressional aides say penalty reform is a strong candidate for enactment even if not this time around although some provisions may be modified 
 he would ease the proposed penalties for delayed <unk> deposits and for <unk> form N and other reports that taxpayers correct voluntarily

 an arbitrator awarded eastern airlines pilots between $ N million and $ N million in back pay a decision that could complicate the carrier 's bankruptcy-law reorganization 
 an eastern spokesman said he does n't expect that the arbitrator 's ruling will have any overall material effect on the company 's strategic plan 
 bankruptcy experts said the law is n't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company 's case 
 that may leave a lot of <unk> for u.s. bankruptcy judge burton r. <unk> to decide what if anything the pilots actually collect 
 eastern and its creditors are in the final delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline 's debts 
 an earlier plan which had received the creditors ' approval in july fell apart when eastern changed its business plan 
 the clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise 
 eastern has disputed the claim but a federal district court an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all <unk> with the pilots 
 another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between eastern and its pilots resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union 
 ironically many of the pilots involved have left eastern or are still striking the carrier which filed for bankruptcy protection march N

 mr. achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country including nissan toyota seagram and backer spielvogel clients hyundai and j.p. morgan

 everything looked good as <unk> walter levy and colleagues carefully cut away a woman 's <unk> tumor at the cleveland clinic in N 
 the shocks generated <unk> <unk> that traveled via <unk> to brain and showed up clearly on a <unk> monitor indicating no damage to the delicate <unk> tissue 
 dr. levy 's answer may come with a new kind of magnetic brain probe a device that he and dozens of u.s. researchers are studying with great hope 
 besides holding the promise of safer <unk> surgery the probe could improve the <unk> of brain and <unk> disorders such as strokes and multiple <unk> 
 the probe which is <unk> <unk> and apparently <unk> employs strong magnetic fields to induce small <unk> of electricity within the brain 
 if positioned over the brain 's <unk> area the hand-held <unk> generate <unk> <unk> that zip down motor nerves and <unk> <unk> making say a finger <unk> 
 in principle they will enable doctors to check the body 's motor system the way an <unk> tests a home 's electrical circuits by running current through them 
 until now we 've had no objective way of measuring motor function says keith <unk> a <unk> conducting clinical tests with the devices at boston 's massachusetts general hospital 
 all we could do was tell a patient squeeze my fingers as hard as you can or raise your arm 
 magnetic brain <unk> started in the early <unk> when researchers produced <unk> of light in the <unk> field with <unk> 
 but for brain tests the <unk> machines would have required patients to stand on their heads says <unk> <unk> a researcher at the university of california at san diego 
 the field took off in N after scientists at britain 's <unk> university developed a handy compact <unk> for brain <unk> 
 since then at least two commercial versions have been put on the u.s. market and an estimated N have been sold 
 in august a chicago conference on such devices attracted more than N researchers who reported studies on everything from brain <unk> to physical therapy 
 we do n't feel we can use the devices routinely in surgery yet but we 're getting close says dr. levy who is now with the university of pittsburgh 
 for example <unk> <unk> victims occasionally have some intact <unk> <unk> that if <unk> by emergency surgery enable partial recovery 
 but such operations typically are n't performed because there is no sign right after an injury that surgery would be beneficial 
 the cost of magnetic stimulators would seem like peanuts if we could retrieve <unk> function in such people dr. <unk> says 
 at least two companies <unk> laboratories inc. of <unk> wash. and <unk> medical systems inc. of <unk> conn. now sell versions of the magnetic devices 
 similarly a <unk> university team led by heart researcher <unk> <unk> hopes to develop ways to <unk> induce <unk> muscle <unk>

 trying to answer that is suggesting all kinds of theories such as precisely where and how the brain processes <unk> signals from the eyes

 among other things the stronger devices may be able to <unk> forth <unk> memories and induce mood changes <unk> say

 there 's just one problem the law that sen. thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the maryland restaurant <unk> and almost all other killings 
 most <unk> are state crimes so any federal <unk> law probably would turn out to be more <unk> than substance 
 senate republicans after repeatedly failing to <unk> <unk> amendments to unrelated legislation have finally gotten a <unk> <unk> bill through committee

 the pending bill introduced by mr. thurmond would revive the <unk> federal <unk> laws by <unk> legal procedures required by the supreme court 
 for instance <unk> would have to consider specific <unk> and <unk> factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death 
 but congressional democrats have blocked the same from <unk> at the federal level with the exception of a N law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related <unk> 
 the thurmond bill would establish a federally <unk> death sentence for N crimes most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the supreme court <unk> 
 amid the <unk> of punitive rhetoric surrounding the issue one critical question involves whether a federal death penalty on top of existing state laws would deter any would-be criminals 
 most of the crimes incorporated in the thurmond bill are <unk> rare killing a supreme court justice for instance or deliberately causing a train <unk> that results in a death 
 it 's <unk> attention from serious issues like how to make <unk> fbi and customs work together on drug enforcement 
 republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the thurmond bill but they contend that is n't the point 
 many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty <unk> many people from the commission of capital crimes says sen. <unk> hatch r. utah 
 in addition to <unk> the old issue of whether death sentences deter criminals this bill has made race a major part of the <unk> debate 
 a large number of studies suggest that state judges and <unk> have imposed the penalty in a <unk> <unk> fashion 
 it would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing <unk> disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past

 revco <unk> inc. the <unk> chain that filed for bankruptcy-court protection last year received a $ N million offer from a group led by texas billionaire robert bass 
 it was revco 's huge debt from its $ N billion leveraged buy-out in N that forced it to seek protection under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code 
 revco insists that the proposal is simply an expression of interest because under chapter N revco has exclusivity rights until feb. N 
 he said he feared a revco reorganization might force bondholders to accept a cheap deal and that the bass group 's offer would give them more money 
 the revco bonds are high-yield high-risk junk bonds holders have $ N million in claims against revco mr. <unk> said 
 revco received the offer oct. N but issued a response yesterday only after a copy of the proposal was made public by bondholders 
 its problem they say is that management paid too much in the leveraged buy-out and the current $ N million debt load is keeping revco in the red

 two of the major factors <unk> prices the prolonged strikes at the highland valley mine in canada and the cananea mine in mexico were finally resolved 
 also the premiums paid by the u.s. government on a purchase of copper for the u.s. mint were lower than expected and acted as a price <unk> analysts said 
 at least one analyst noted that as production improves the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies 
 demand from japan is expected to continue strong but not from other areas of the world into the first quarter of next year he said 
 japan normally depends heavily on the highland valley and cananea mines as well as the bougainville mine in <unk> new guinea 
 according to fred demler metals economist for drexel burnham lambert new york highland valley has already started operating and cananea is expected to do so soon 
 according to drexel 's mr. demler the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly which may be one reason why the situation did n't affect prices much 
 another analyst said that if there was any concern it was that a strike could encourage other <unk> in chile 
 mr. demler said that stocks of copper in u.s. producers ' hands at the end of september were down N metric tons from august to N tons

 their only doubt concerned the possibility that mr. gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would <unk> and that the whole process might be reversed 
 and has he truly persuaded the communist party to accept economic change of a kind that will sooner or later lead to its demise 
 permission is far from automatic the soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions and they appear to be exercising these powers 
 private <unk> for example is allowed in N soviet republics but banned by five <unk> is allowed in seven but illegal in nine 
 all independent media activity is now illegal which perhaps is not surprising but so is the manufacture of <unk> cosmetics household chemicals and sand <unk> 
 if mr. gorbachev is looking toward <unk> the productive forces of the market these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless 
 the emergence of russian <unk> had been anticipated in journalist george urban 's introduction to a series of <unk> can the soviet system survive reform published this spring 
 the <unk> concept of <unk> <unk> an organic society in which citizens were <unk> and morally unified and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation 
 this unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would <unk> workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and <unk> society 
 the key to the creation of the organic state lay in the formation of natural groups that would <unk> the role of <unk> 
 by contrast a parliamentary system based on <unk> political rights and groups was held to cause rather than resolve conflict 
 the <unk> of soviet perestroika to the <unk> social blueprint of <unk> was evident when mr. gorbachev presented his economic vision to the soviet congress 
 instead he proposed a <unk> economy in which there would be a <unk> division between state direction of the economy and economic management 
 these would not function <unk> but would act together to form combines unions and associations to tackle problems and coordinate their activities 
 mr. gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the <unk> ideal than was <unk> who was never able to influence business giants such as <unk> and fiat 
 the soviet communist party has the power to shape corporate development and <unk> it into a body dependent upon it 
 to ensure the loyalty of the business sector mr. gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests probably by restricting competition 
 it is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the <unk> model attractive to both the party and labor 
 the most important development in mr. gorbachev 's policy for <unk> the opposition movement is the claim that the u.s.s.r. also <unk> from terrorism 
 it is possible that in <unk> such <unk> the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism 
 the weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations mr. gorbachev is a <unk> political leader perhaps one of the greatest but in its economic prescription

 the south was off N N after the first nine months while the north central region was up N N 
 newly contracted residential work edged up N N in september to an annualized $ N billion largely because <unk> building rebounded from a very weak august 
 at the end of the third quarter there was still no evidence of renewed home building in response to the midyear decline of mortgage rates mr. christie said 
 commercial and industrial construction rose sharply partly because of three large projects each expected to cost more than $ N million

 the sweep by the <unk> whose <unk> and <unk> <unk> dominated the <unk> giants will only make things worse for abc owned by capital cities\/abc inc 
 but some industry executives said abc in anticipation of a four-game sweep limited its losses by <unk> up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games 
 a world series <unk> typically carries N <unk> commercials but by the fourth game abc was <unk> in N to N ads to generate extra revenue 
 but other industry executives contend the losses could reach $ N million over four years and could go even higher if the world series end in four-game <unk> 
 the series got off to a <unk> start oct. N with a N N rating the next night it drew N N of homes 
 some people had hoped abc 's ratings would go up because of the intense focus on the event in the aftermath of the earthquake

 if japanese companies are so efficient why does <unk> transportation co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to osaka 
 why until last spring did the long-term credit bank of japan sometimes take several days to correct <unk> errors in its paper work for international transactions 
 because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the u.s. and western europe japanese corporations ' reputation as <unk> <unk> is only half right 
 their factories may look like sets for a <unk> movie but their offices with rows of <unk> <unk> over <unk> and <unk> are more like scenes from a <unk> novel 
 overall pc sales in japan in the first half of N were N N higher than in the year-earlier period 
 and with a labor shortage and intense competitive pressure to improve efficiency more and more japanese companies are concluding that they have no choice 
 japan may be a tough market for outsiders to <unk> and the u.s. is <unk> behind japan in certain technologies 
 typical is one office of the ministry of international trade and industry 's machinery and information industries bureau the main bureaucracy overseeing the computer industry 
 while american pc sales have averaged roughly N N annual growth since N and west european sales a <unk> N N japanese sales were flat for most of that time 
 the market planning and sales promotion office of nomura securities co. for example has more than N computers for its N workers a respectable ratio 
 meanwhile a woman sitting next to a new fujitsu terminal writes stock-market information on a chart with a pencil and adds it up with a hand <unk> 
 in the u.s. more than half the pc software sold is either for <unk> or for <unk> analysis according to lotus 
 machines dedicated solely to word processing which have all but disappeared in the u.s. are still more common in japan than pcs 
 computers here are used for data gathering says roger j. <unk> who manages the <unk> group in <unk> & co. 's tokyo office 
 some japanese operations such as <unk> rooms may be ahead of their american counterparts he says but basically there 's little analysis done on computers in japan 
 of course simply buying computers does n't always solve problems and many american companies have <unk> by purchasing technology they did n't understand 
 because the japanese <unk> is so huge japan has no history of <unk> use and so <unk> <unk> especially among older workers remains a common <unk> 
 while most american employees have their own private space japanese <unk> usually share large common tables and rely heavily on old-fashioned personal contact 
 top japanese executives often make decisions based on consensus and personal relationships rather than complex financial projections and fancy <unk> 
 besides a computer processing the japanese language needs a huge memory and much processing capability while the screen and printer need far better definition to <unk> accurately the <unk> <unk> 
 for the past decade nec corp. has owned more than half the japanese pc market and ruled it with <unk> power 
 nec wo n't release its code and every one of the dozen or so makers has its own <unk> operating system all <unk> with each other 
 ibm established its standard to try to stop falling behind <unk> apple computer but nec was ahead from the start and did n't need to <unk> in competitive allies 
 most rivals have a working relationship with nec often through <unk> of technology the japan personal computer software association noted recently 
 while tens of thousands of software packages using the ibm standard are available in the u.s. they say only about N are written for nec 
 a year ago japan 's fair trade commission warned nec about possible violations of <unk> laws for discouraging retailers from discounting 
 an nec spokeswoman <unk> that prices are higher in japan because customers put a greater emphasis on quality and service than they do in the u.s. 
 she adds that some technological advances trail those in the u.s. because the japanese still import basic operating systems from american companies 
 <unk> <unk> corp. a <unk> to the industry fought off a legal challenge and started selling nec <unk> last year 
 sony corp. which temporarily dropped out of the pc business three years ago started selling its work station in N and quickly became the leading japanese company in that market 
 in a country where <unk> room is scarce laptop machines will take a large portion of the industry 's future growth 
 many of the companies are even dropping their traditional independence and trying to band together to create some sort of standard 
 two years ago most of the smaller makers joined under the microsoft corp. <unk> to adopt a version of the american ibm at standard 
 that has n't generated much sales but this summer microsoft rallied all the major nec competitors to make their new machines compatible with the ibm <unk> standard 
 a healthy <unk> japanese market could also make it far easier for japanese companies to sell overseas where their share is still minimal 
 as with many other goods the american share of japan 's pc market is far below that in the rest of the world 
 if it were an open market we would have been in in N or N says <unk> pfeiffer who heads compaq computer corp. 's european and international operations 
 although it has opened a new zealand subsidiary it is still only studying japan the only nation that has n't adopted <unk> specifications 
 and because general retail centers such as <unk> have little presence in japan sales remain in the iron grip of established computer makers 
 apple did n't introduce a <unk> machine one that handles the chinese characters of written japanese until three years after entering the market 
 apple recently hired its first japanese president <unk> away an official of toshiba 's european operations as well as a whole japanese <unk> team

 from a reading of the somewhat <unk> <unk> medical literature on ru-486 the french abortion pill emerges as one of the <unk> <unk> around 
 it is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her <unk> period up through the seventh week of pregnancy when it is <unk> less effective 
 but safe in the definition of <unk> bass of the reproductive health technologies project means there 's been no evidence so far of mortality 
 however dr. <unk> <unk> the french physician who invented ru-486 wrote in a science magazine article last month that the <unk> results could not be <unk> in <unk> and <unk> 
 all the published studies recommend that women on whom the drug proves <unk> not carry the pregnancy to term but <unk> a surgical abortion 
 a risk of birth defects a sure source of lawsuits is one reason the u.s. pharmaceutical industry is steering clear of ru-486 
 many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion 
 the health and human services department currently <unk> the national institutes of health from funding abortion research as part of its $ N million contraceptive program 
 its <unk> prediction the pill will be available in the u.s. either legally or illegally in no more than N years 
 furthermore because timing is so critical with ru-486 she will learn via a <unk> examination and <unk> not only that she is pregnant but just how pregnant she is 
 it also could put the government into the ru-486 business which would please <unk> <unk> at what they view as <unk> in the private-sector drug industry 
 we do not know whether ru-486 will be as <unk> as some of the earlier <unk> methods released to <unk> <unk> <unk> from educated people who should have known better 
 some of the biggest <unk> exporters american <unk> companies for example have yet to be fully included in our export statistics 
 nearly N years ago representatives of <unk> companies worked out a plan with the commerce department to improve the data on <unk> exports

 merrill 's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading <unk> of recent days because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers 
 merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading including tough margin or <unk> requirements and limits on price moves for <unk> financial futures 
 last thursday painewebber group inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether but the firm was n't as big an index <unk> as merrill is 
 other large firms including bear stearns & co. and morgan stanley & co. last week announced a <unk> from index arbitrage but only for the firms ' own accounts 
 kidder made an abrupt <unk> on program trading yesterday after a special meeting between the firm 's president and chief executive officer michael carpenter and its senior managers 
 just a week ago mr. carpenter <unk> defended index arbitrage at kidder the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year 
 index arbitrage mr. carpenter said last week does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole and kidder 's customers were sophisticated enough to know that 
 kidder denied that ge 's chairman and chief executive john f. welch had anything to do with kidder 's decision 
 supporters of index arbitrage have n't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy as some did during the post-crash outcry of N 
 but merrill lynch in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage suggested that the current debate has missed the mark 
 merrill said it continues to believe that the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy 
 meanwhile bear stearns chairman and chief executive alan c. greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients 
 at the firm 's annual meeting last night he told shareholders that index arbitrage wo n't go away despite the public outcry 
 if they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few wall street firms to quit they are crazy mr. greenberg said 
 in response to a shareholder 's suggestion mr. greenberg agreed that european firms will simply pick up the index-arbitrage business left behind by u.s. institutions

 the agency which is funded through insurance premiums from employers <unk> pension benefits for some N million private-sector workers who take part in <unk> pension plans 
 the filing was partly the result of the $ N billion <unk> in ltv 's three pension plans operated for its ltv steel co. subsidiary 's employees 
 in january N as ltv steel continued operating while under reorganization the agency terminated the three ltv pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing 
 termination means that the agency 's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans but workers do n't <unk> new benefits 
 a few months later under pressure from the united steelworkers of america ltv instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans 
 because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans ltv would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans 
 ltv challenged the order and a federal district court in new york in june N ruled that the agency improperly ordered ltv to <unk> responsibility for the plans 
 the appeals court also said the agency had to consider a company 's long-term ability to fund pension plans not just short-term improved financial status 
 in dallas ltv said that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because it believes the move will further delay its chapter N proceedings 
 the company has n't been able to come up with a reorganization plan in part because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency

 paul <unk> a new york lawyer who represents des victims said that before the new york ruling only the states of washington and wisconsin had followed the california decision

 in N the fda banned the use of des after studies linked it to cancer and other problems in daughters of women who took the drug 
 under traditional legal theories inability to prove which company manufactured a drug that caused an injury or death would lead to the lawsuit being dismissed 
 the new york court also upheld a state law passed in N extending for one year the statute of limitations on filing des lawsuits 
 the effect is that lawsuits that might have been barred because they were filed too late could proceed because of the one-year extension

 medical scientists are starting to <unk> a handful of genes which if damaged <unk> the chaotic growth of cells that <unk> cancer 
 scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops 
 an emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention 
 already scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that for the first time can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer 
 it 's a <unk> set of <unk> says <unk> vogelstein a johns hopkins university researcher who has just found a gene <unk> to the triggering of colon cancer 
 today we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can <unk> a cancer and then <unk> it into a deadly state 
 either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth so for cancer to arise both copies must be <unk> 
 emerging genetic tests will be able to spot such <unk> individuals <unk> in what some scientists believe is a new age of <unk> cancer <unk> 
 because of the <unk> of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene it became possible last january to find out what threat the <unk> baby faced 
 all this may not be obvious to the public which is concerned about advances in treatment but i am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon 
 soon after that report two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and <unk> cancers 
 colon lung and <unk> cancers are the most common and <unk> forms of the disease <unk> killing almost N americans a year 
 right now about a dozen laboratories in the u.s. canada and britain are racing to <unk> other suspected <unk> genes 
 researchers say the <unk> of tumor-suppressor genes alone or in combination appears crucial to the development of such <unk> as cancer of the brain the skin kidney <unk> and <unk> 
 there is evidence that if people <unk> defective versions of these genes they are especially prone to cancer perhaps explaining finally why some cancers seem to <unk> certain families 
 the story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s when a <unk> named alfred g. <unk> jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects 
 he <unk> that in the eye cancer an <unk> inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other 
 back then scientists had no way of <unk> out specific genes but under a <unk> they could see the N <unk> of <unk> in the cells that contain the genes 
 dr. <unk> found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome no. N from a parent who had had the disease 
 he assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer 
 the team used a battery of the newly developed gene <unk> <unk> of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell 
 by analyzing cells <unk> from eye <unk> they found defects in the second copy of chromosome N in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome 
 it was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the <unk> of a cancer 
 his was one of two research teams in N to report dual chromosome losses for a rare <unk> cancer of the kidney called <unk> 's tumor 
 dr. vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer the second biggest cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer 
 he believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple hits on cancer <unk> genes because it often seems to develop in stages 
 dr. vogelstein and a <unk> student eric <unk> began months of <unk> and often frustrating probing of the <unk> searching for signs of genetic damage 
 they began <unk> a confusing variety of genetic <unk> some existing only in benign <unk> others in malignant cells and many in both <unk> and malignant cells 
 but dr. vogelstein had yet to <unk> the identity of the gene that if damaged <unk> a colon cell into <unk> <unk> 
 but mr. levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth <unk> the johns hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that <unk> growth 
 the discovery suddenly puts an <unk> gene right in the <unk> of cancer formation says robert <unk> a leader in <unk> research at <unk> institute in cambridge mass 
 researchers in <unk> scotland have found that in N of N <unk> <unk> one copy of chromosome N was <unk> at the spot where gene p53 lies 
 the scientists say that since <unk> cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families the gene when inherited in a damaged form may <unk> women to the cancer 
 there also are reports from several labs as yet unpublished of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney brain and skin cancers 
 dr. <unk> believes people who <unk> a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome N are especially prone to lung cancer 
 recently he and others reported that the retinoblastoma <unk> gene may also be involved in some lung cancers as well as several other more common cancers too 
 some researchers say new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the <unk> proteins normally produced by the genes 
 it may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions though no one has come close to doing that so far 
 in any case says dr. <unk> of the national cancer institute we 're <unk> the discovery of one of the most important steps in the <unk> of cancer

 <unk> overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business which accounted for half of the dutch chemical company 's sales led to huge losses and left akzo 's survival in doubt 
 now as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms akzo says it is in far better shape to cope 
 aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants akzo has spent N billion guilders $ N billion on acquisitions since N to give it better balance 
 the fibers business whose products go into <unk> carpeting and <unk> industrial uses now accounts for only N N of akzo 's sales 
 still akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs 
 mr. bergsma said prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area 
 analysts expect the company to show profit of about N million guilders up N N from N million guilders a year earlier 
 he figures akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year 
 the bank projects akzo will show per-share earnings of N guilders in N up from an estimated N guilders for this year and the N guilders reported for N 
 at james capel & co. in london analyst <unk> <unk> notes that akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products 
 thus while akzo <unk> less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics it has less to fear from the current slump 
 a decline may come in the first half of N he said but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn 
 akzo 's biggest move in this area was the N acquisition of <unk> chemical co. 's specialty chemical business for $ N million 
 but akzo is still <unk> down it recently announced plans to eliminate about N <unk> jobs in the netherlands and west germany 
 sales growth of N N a year seems possible he said and akzo expects its <unk> business to become profitable in N 
 in august for example it completed the $ N million acquisition of reliance universal inc. a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from tyler corp 
 mr. bergsma said akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it <unk> cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale 
 for akzo 's drug business where profits have shown <unk> change for the past five years mr. bergsma predicted moderate profit growth 
 akzo is the leading seller of <unk> pills in europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the u.s. and japan 
 he is a politician with the <unk> of true conviction as in <unk> <unk> exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to N N 
 british politicians divide into two groups of <unk> those with their <unk> cut and those <unk> the sky is falling 
 the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free-market economists divide into at least three <unk> camps 
 there are the strict <unk> who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates 
 he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially <unk> fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system 
 while no doubt agreeing with mr. lawson on everything else sir alan is a <unk> <unk> inclined to defend floating rates to the death 
 they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows 
 as in the u.s. it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <unk> 
 at this point the options were crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound 
 or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the chancellor argued and ensure the <unk> of this policy by joining the ems 
 faced with a similar situation paul <unk> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly <unk> issued <unk> warnings of inflation 
 he <unk> inflation along with rapid growth no doubt <unk> sir alan 's predictions in the prime minister 's mind 
 but more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost <unk> to the high interest rates mr. lawson deployed to stop it 
 we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson 's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major 
 to begin with we should note that in contrast to the u.s. deficit britain has been running <unk> budget surpluses 
 the wage <unk> which <unk> studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation 
 we should also concede that in the british experience the <unk> cause <unk> some of the credibility it lost in the u.s. experience 
 somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <unk> but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity 
 in <unk> rates the choice of initial <unk> is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong <unk> rate 
 we <unk> with mrs. thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one <unk> by the domestic political <unk> of west germany 
 mr. reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession 
 we would add that in political terms mrs. thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser 
 in particular <unk> a currency is anything but <unk> it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility 
 in the end his move was sparked by remarks in <unk> from sir alan 's <unk> in the american economist a <unk> academic journal 
 surrounded by <unk> of paper two computers and photos of himself <unk> and flying mr. phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency 
 ogilvy under the <unk> mr. roman gained a reputation as occasionally being <unk> in its treatment of clients of <unk> what strategy a client should indeed must follow 
 and some of its top <unk> executives including mr. phillips were <unk> to the point they were <unk> with administrative duties with little time to see clients 
 but mr. phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by <unk> much of his administrative work to a deputy 
 he also plans to get to know clients that mr. roman was closer to such as <unk> brothers american express and seagram 
 the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins 
 clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said 
 mr. phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the wpp takeover 
 the reorganization is supposed to make <unk> shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or ogilvy <unk> in <unk> a reality 
 under the reorganization ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client 's single contact for all those services 
 there is little or no integration of our work quality is <unk> there is no single focus mr. phillips complained to staffers in march when the reorganization was announced 
 now mr. phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including american express american telephone & telegraph and ryder by year 's end 
 under his watch office <unk> was often rampant in the agency 's new york operation and the office there has had a dismal <unk> record for more than a year 
 the one thing mr. phillips clearly does have going for him is <unk> although it is n't certain if that will be enough 
 as mr. <unk> says the last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia as we call it 
 while mr. roman is a <unk> <unk> mr. phillips would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office 
 ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive <unk> room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives 
 the fact that the agency will now be part of a u.k. company under british accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better 
 the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could <unk> have an adverse impact on <unk> mr. <unk> wrote 
 he said mr. klein will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be <unk>

 for the first time since the mid-1970s westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants 
 most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years 
 westinghouse 's earnings could be <unk> enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner says russell l. <unk> of salomon brothers inc 
 already this year it has received orders for four <unk> advanced combustion <unk> from florida power & light co. and for two <unk> plants from <unk> energy corp. among others

 the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability

 in response mr. peters says mr. ross referred to his colleagues at warner with an <unk> and said tell them that they do n't have a job

 some in hollywood suggest mr. guber and mr. peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such as mr. semel and mr. canton too literally

 the bolstered cellular agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin broadcasting corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off mccaw cellular communications inc. the rival suitor for lin 
 moreover the amended pact shows how mccaw 's <unk> has pushed lin and bellsouth into a corner forcing huge debt on the proposed new company 
 the debt estimated at $ N billion could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to <unk> some lin holders in the short term 
 the plan still calls for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations 
 lin said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained

 other <unk> <unk> program trading also causes the nasdaq composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market 
 because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many otc stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as <unk> 
 moreover the price volatility that is <unk> by program trading is <unk> efforts to woo individual investors back to an otc market that <unk> misses them 
 but the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been <unk> from the practice against it 
 we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs says mr. dapuzzo who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility 
 of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days 
 that 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the N crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity <unk> 
 market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling 
 and to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became <unk> to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress 
 on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares 
 it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose says mr. <unk> of donaldson lufkin

 some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a <unk> bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending <unk> with congress 
 the issue arose last week when vice president dan quayle told an audience in chicago that mr. bush was looking for a test case 
 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater confirmed that mr. bush was interested in the idea but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it 
 mr. bush former president reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process 
 they maintain that a president needs the ability to <unk> remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills 
 those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their <unk> because they often are needed to keep the government operating 
 there 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved 
 he notes that as a <unk> from the san francisco area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the bay area rapid transit system 
 but there may be another problem with the device despite all the political <unk> it would cause it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit 
 still proponents contend that the veto would have what mr. <unk> calls an important <unk> effect on all manner of appropriations bills 
 lawmakers they say would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later 
 indeed although a majority of republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto some ranging from liberal oregon sen. mark <unk> to conservative rep. edwards are opposed 
 rep. edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person

 in april when many of them bought their cds six-month certificates were yielding more than N N investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts 
 now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd is just under N N and N N is about the best around 
 short-term municipal bonds bond funds and <unk> annuities are some of the choices they mention and not just as a way to get a higher return 
 yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years 
 that 's because <unk> interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for <unk> investors 
 for an investor paying tax at a N N rate a seemingly <unk> N N yield on a one-year <unk> is equivalent to a taxable N N 
 these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired

 you get <unk> returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says james e. wilson a columbia s.c. planner 
 if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields 
 for instance a <unk> annuity from north american co. for life & health insurance chicago offers N N interest for one year or a N N rate for two years 
 the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down 
 with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag 
 still today 's <unk> money funds may beat cds over the next year even if rates fall says guy <unk> an editor of the bond market <unk> newsletter in atlanta 
 if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund

 this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures 
 these procedures consume millions of <unk> of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five year defense plan promptly <unk> away 
 the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats 
 they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets 
 negative money was invented in N to make the N five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president reagan 's final budget <unk> to congress

 most <unk> including those in the congressional budget office assume inflation will be in excess of N N in each of those five years

 this scenario has been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it reduces the baseline by $ N billion between N and N 
 scenario N the current dollar freeze has been the <unk> position of the house of representatives for about four years 
 it <unk> the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until N 
 scenario N <unk> the recent <unk> between the house and the senate it <unk> the difference between scenarios N and N by increasing the budget at N N per year 
 finally scenario N reduces the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion 
 the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario <unk> strengths and <unk> weaknesses 
 some may be <unk> to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the carter administration 
 but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff and therefore <unk> into a <unk> drill driven by budget politics 
 it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to <unk> budget cutting by an irresponsible congress 
 this argument plays well in the atmosphere of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the pentagon and congress and unfortunately there is some truth to it

 as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on wall street say it is time to consider extreme measures

 the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day 
 since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says 
 futures do n't need defending says andrew <unk> a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange which trades the s&p N by far the largest stock-index futures contract

 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 
 one reason futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down 
 some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses 
 thus they say futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most

 as the soviet union <unk> with its worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system 
 the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy 
 they lay out a clear timetable and <unk> for <unk> the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business 
 they also address such <unk> subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways to soften the social consequences 
 while many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its <unk> and presumed <unk> <unk> 
 although it was published <unk> in the latest edition of the weekly <unk> <unk> soviet sources say the article was written by <unk> <unk> and a small group of colleagues 
 mr. <unk> head of the academy of science 's institute of economics was recently appointed deputy chairman of the soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform 
 for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped 
 seeking a middle path between opponents of change and <unk> who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a <unk> approach 
 the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year 
 the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy <unk> to success simply do n't exist 
 most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest 
 the document proposes breaking up the <unk> system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to <unk> helped by tough <unk> legislation 
 the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and N including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures 
 such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now <unk> guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform

 alongside the current <unk> ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies 
 a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system 
 but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect

 if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on <unk> businesses or cut spending in already <unk> neighborhoods 
 his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money 
 the thing about the dinkins <unk> is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario <unk> 
 he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody 
 rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head 
 keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day

 mr. dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch denies that the manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues 
 on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble 
 some supporters were stunned this summer when mr. dinkins suggested weakening the law <unk> public employees to go on strike

 then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants

 in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents 
 and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city 
 many <unk> officials say the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save N chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson 
 mr. dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both <unk> and <unk> leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential 
 a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson 
 another close ally is ruth <unk> a manhattan city <unk> some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into mr. dinkins 's position papers 
 if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor 
 but lincoln center president nathan leventhal who would head a dinkins transition team is more mainstream as is real-estate executive anthony <unk> another insider 
 some business leaders and others also believe that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background 
 names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard <unk> former schools chancellor frank <unk> and messrs. leventhal and <unk> 
 then there are mr. dinkins 's <unk> <unk> colleagues such as u.s. rep. <unk> former deputy mayor paterson and mr. sutton 
 part of mr. dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the brooklyn and <unk> <unk> 
 adds ms. <unk> who is expected to win the borough president 's job mr. dinkins is <unk> you have to remember david is a <unk>

 the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble as market participants switched out of pounds 
 the pound also dropped <unk> against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to N marks from N marks late wednesday 
 mr. lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent <unk> speculation of a <unk> between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher

 on an office wall of the senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from chairman david boren do n't hold your ticket <unk> the show 's over 
 he once used that line in a <unk> meeting on panama meaning do n't shrink from taking action against manuel noriega 
 so how did a good senator like this end up <unk> a policy that required the u.s. to warn mr. noriega of any coup plot against him 
 george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to gop senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama <unk> to congress 
 the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council 
 staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u.s. could not do to oust the panamanian <unk> 
 mr. boren himself did n't discover the <unk> <unk> until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week 
 he 's the senator most like arthur <unk> the gop senator from michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine mr. boren says referring as well to sam <unk> the democratic house speaker who <unk> with president <unk> 
 ohio democrat howard <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a <unk> notion for a great power 
 by october when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done 
 mr. boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress has made mistakes 
 writing in the harvard international review he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a consensus 
 elliott abrams a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the <unk> <unk> would have taken place if consensus had been required 
 <unk> and <unk> were <unk> enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators mr. boren notwithstanding are less modest 
 he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they do n't disagree 
 maybe this will jolt us out of the <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says 
 but it 's just as <unk> to argue that if even david boren can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation

 bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a <unk> of lawsuits 
 however some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned <unk> <unk> as two years ago 
 in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees 
 doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn 
 moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say 
 the decision by a majority of <unk> waertsilae marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt <unk> from previous government policy 
 at the time <unk> by oy waertsilae a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion <unk> and was on the brink of liquidation 
 government officials were expected to combine waertsilae marine with two other struggling firms and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation 
 the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was <unk> when the parent waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute 
 after the restructuring of waertsilae marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors union bank of finland and state-controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital 
 but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been <unk> about the shipyard 's actual financial condition and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn 
 then in a <unk> <unk> <unk> directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister <unk> <unk> 
 analysts say mr. <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae marine 's losses <unk> to more than double the figure estimated in august 
 senior ministry officials <unk> with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae marine operating 
 indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change <unk> and agree to pick up the bill analysts said 
 turner broadcasting system inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ N million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt

 <unk> australia ltd. under pressure from bank lenders has called in accounting firm peat <unk> <unk> to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company

 yesterday mr. skase said the company is <unk> and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments 
 the government is <unk> its newest weapon against white-collar defendants the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills 
 a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs 
 mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges 
 under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law or rico the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial 
 in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized 
 in newark u.s. attorney samuel a. <unk> said i do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases 
 mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission 
 in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to <unk> the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period 
 through his lawyers mr. antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others 
 the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits 
 mr. antar the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N 
 according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made 
 still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees 
 they also worry that if the government applies <unk> laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid 
 since like earthquakes stock market <unk> will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible <unk> against another such market collapse 
 these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages uncertainty <unk> an extra risk premium and <unk> triggered additional selling pressures 
 the situation was like that of a <unk> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected <unk> on the <unk> 
 his <unk> spread <unk> and <unk> apart just as <unk> spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control 
 after the N crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to <unk> and restore orderly market conditions 
 in the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone 
 the stock market is the only major market without a <unk> of <unk> liquidity or a buyer of last resort 
 this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market 
 they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares 
 the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $ N billion and $ N billion 
 the $ N billion the fed <unk> into the money markets after the N crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day 
 and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in october N 
 it should seek only to maintain the <unk> of markets not to <unk> up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level 
 it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares 
 the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the <unk> the liquidity of the banks 
 but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the guidelines to floating in N such difficulties have been avoided

 intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its N microprocessor chip 's <unk> unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations 
 on friday intel began <unk> customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some <unk> calculations 
 but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. say the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them 
 bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said richard <unk> director of hewlett-packard co. 's advanced systems development 
 yesterday compaq plunged further closing at $ N a share off $ N a share on volume of N shares 
 most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations 
 what 's more the bugs only emerge on <unk> applications such as <unk> design and scientific calculations he said and then very seldom 
 the real <unk> they said are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil <unk> products 
 the reason this is getting so much <unk> is that some started shipping and announced early availability said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 
 in late september ibm began shipping a <unk> card that <unk> its <unk> model <unk> from a N machine to an N machine 
 ibm has no plans to recall its <unk> cards the spokeswoman said and could probably <unk> the bugs without long product delays 
 that 's a break from compaq tradition because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers 
 although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the N is an extremely <unk> product said mr. <unk> the newsletter editor 
 unveiled last april the chip <unk> N million <unk> on a <unk> of silicon more than four times as many as on intel 's earlier model N 
 machines using the N are expected to challenge <unk> work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called <unk> which <unk> groups of computers together and in <unk> design 
 but while the chip 's speed in processing power is <unk> it 's real strength lies in its software <unk> 
 the N is the <unk> of a long series of intel chips that began <unk> the market ever since ibm picked the <unk> N chip for its first personal computer 
 since then intel has <unk> a large part of the market with <unk> generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models

 the communication mr. lee brought represents the softer line the u.s. has been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june N massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 
 the chinese leader mr. lee informed mr. bush expressed some regret for what had happened in beijing and conceded that china 's officials <unk> some responsibility 
 mr. lee says mr. deng told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed <unk> materials and went on <unk> strikes 
 and he told the <unk> that china 's leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families 
 he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush but that the white house <unk> invited him to do so 
 according to u.s. sources in beijing the administration hopes mr. deng 's fairly <unk> comments will <unk> congress to be cautious about further sanctions against beijing

 but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to N rubles to the dollar 
 but it did n't elaborate and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut 
 western tourists in the soviet union who could exchange a dollar <unk> illegally for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered N rubles or more 
 even at such rates black <unk> have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here 
 they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge <unk> 
 the going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ N in the west is anywhere from N to N rubles 
 the <unk> of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone the afternoon newspaper <unk> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation 
 rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in moscow for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise 
 plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been <unk> by a lack of hard currency 
 soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate 
 the kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods 
 but the amounts they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors 
 unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad 
 over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of <unk> travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad 
 but under current rules they are allowed to change just N rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip 
 international business machines corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of eastman kodak co. 's <unk> needs 
 kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard <unk> digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs 
 the loss is a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration 
 that 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide <unk> communications and computing services to major corporations 
 he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project

 some of the would-be reformers however want to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it 
 in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both <unk> <unk> members of the federal reserve board 
 he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> has introduced a bill in congress <unk> by rep. lee hamilton d. ind. that would put the treasury secretary back on the board 
 there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something 
 nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much 
 after the october N market crash mr. brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it 
 one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency probably the federal reserve should coordinate regulation of all financial markets 
 this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job 
 the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it appears to have handled them well 
 in recent weeks moreover mr. brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> university economist noted that the fed 's record included the longest most sustained <unk> inflation in our history dating from either N or N to N 
 the <unk> argument is an old one but mr. brady on the board or off is surely trying to influence fed policy 
 equally <unk> the treasury secretary has <unk> the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping <unk> for west german marks and japanese yen 
 the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed 
 the fed has been <unk> in foreign currency markets all right but through august at least it appeared to be <unk> the intervention 
 when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them <unk> a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do 
 the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is 
 this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow 
 it has also been a week when <unk> washington has had a high old time <unk> over <unk> reagan 's multimillion-dollar <unk> in japan 
 in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something 
 those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake 
 all of that is just for <unk> or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding 
 all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down 
 as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well 
 the theme song for the 1980s has been anything goes and it has been <unk> with <unk> from wall street to some of the highest <unk> of <unk> 
 and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said i should n't and <unk> it out 
 as a last <unk> when all else has failed and you are <unk> <unk> for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong 
 consider the troubling <unk> between mr. shevardnadze 's speech of <unk> this week and the <unk> defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair 
 the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station 
 we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently is n't going to change 
 no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the <unk> construction of the law 
 the <unk> media <unk> hunt about some politician 's private <unk> notwithstanding the general <unk> is to offer a version of the old <unk> who am i to judge

 we did n't <unk> into it we <unk> and slipped down the long <unk> and now we have as its <unk> symbol a former president <unk> for a foreign <unk>

 if a bid <unk> at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains 
 last april mr. drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to N N of cineplex for c$ N a share from bronfman associates

 in geneva where world trade talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt the european community called the u.s. proposal a step <unk> 
 the u.s. in a far-reaching plan submitted to the geneva meeting tuesday proposed curbing price support subsidies within N years and eliminating export subsidies within five years 
 but the ec reacted <unk> arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the common agricultural policy the ec 's $ N <unk> price support program 
 ec officials say they are <unk> that the u.s. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export <unk> not just reduction 
 the u.s. proposal also was criticized by <unk> developing countries who said that the u.s. made no special <unk> for poor nations

 two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and <unk>

 mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation 
 the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits <unk> for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching <unk> or research 
 district court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call <unk> 
 but judge leval felt <unk> by an earlier decision of the second circuit court <unk> a <unk> of <unk> salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters 
 he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject 
 moreover and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question responsible <unk> and <unk> constantly use primary sources letters <unk> and <unk> 
 now scholars in <unk> their responsibility do not claim the right to <unk> every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation 
 and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own <unk> or as donated or sold to <unk> 
 but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act 
 and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points 
 if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk>

 a proposed <unk> policy for federally funded <unk> researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures say financiers researchers and university administrators 
 the national institutes of health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses or lose their government money 
 among other concerns the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to <unk> findings in order to <unk> new drugs 
 but the guidelines could make it impossible to <unk> research says kenneth smith associate <unk> and vice president for research at massachusetts institute of technology 
 the guidelines could <unk> future arrangements similar to the deal behind <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. start-up says robert daly a managing partner of <unk> associates a venture-capital firm 
 with $ N million he and other investors launched <unk> last year to market a <unk> cure being developed by researchers of the university of california at san diego 
 the researchers who are being financed by the <unk> funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product 
 but because the university of california like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may <unk> itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines mr. daly says 
 for instance commonwealth <unk> inc. a venture-capital concern last month invested $ N to launch <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. concern that will produce pharmaceuticals 
 while ms. <unk> left mit to head <unk> prof. <unk> will continue to work at mit serve on <unk> 's board and own a small equity stake in the company 
 while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its <unk> says <unk> w. <unk> of commonwealth 
 but the new guidelines could prevent scientists like prof. <unk> from being involved with <unk> such as <unk> venture capitalists point out 
 last year venture capitalists spent an estimated $ N million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the national venture capital association a trade group 
 many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to <unk> their work in return for an equity stake or royalties 
 in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says lawrence <unk> of <unk> ventures la jolla calif 
 but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work 
 for its part nih insists that its guidelines should not <unk> research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use 
 nih staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the <unk> of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures 
 not long ago scientists holding stock in <unk> pharmaceutical services inc. were accused of <unk> research to boost the stock 
 among other provisions the nih guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research 
 ms. <unk> the nih administrator says the business and scientific community is <unk> to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion

 merksamer jewelers inc. a fast-growing jewelry store chain filed for chapter N bankruptcy-law protection from creditors apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain 
 the filing made yesterday in u.s. bankruptcy court here follows an agreement by l.j. hooker corp. merksamer 's owner to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price 
 ge capital corp. a financial services subsidiary of general electric co. is providing merksamer management with $ N million in financing 
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta filed for chapter N protection in august and has also announced its intention to sell its b. altman & co. department store chain 
 l.j. hooker is owned by hooker corp. sydney australia which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 rumors to the effect that the merksamer chain would file for chapter N arose last week in the jewelry industry 
 one executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of l.j. hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j. hooker 's assets 
 by filing for chapter N the merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale not the hundreds of unsecured creditors said this executive 
 the jewelry chain which is based in sacramento calif. had revenue of $ N million and operating profit of $ N million for the year ended june N 
 for all of this year 's explosive <unk> in stock prices renaissance investment management inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines 
 wall street executives said they believed that renaissance 's $ N million buy program was carried out by painewebber inc 
 as reported painewebber bought shares tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift although the broker 's client was said then to have been japanese 
 the broker winning the business does n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price 
 in tuesday 's <unk> session the dow jones industrial average fell by N points early in the day but finished with less than a <unk> loss 
 renaissance 's last portfolio shift carried out by goldman sachs & co. was a highly publicized decision last january to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy treasury bills 
 the sell signal which sent a bearish <unk> through the stock market came when renaissance 's computer found that stocks were <unk> compared with bonds and treasury bills 
 almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills 
 so why does renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at N where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the dow at N 
 with the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates stocks are representing a better value all the time renaissance president frank w. <unk> said yesterday 
 stock prices meanwhile are about N points lower than the peak of N reached on the dow industrial average oct. N 
 mr. <unk> wo n't say specifically explaining that if there was such a move it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction 
 during that time a buyer with the clout of a renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it <unk> its hand 
 competing <unk> firms march to their own computer models so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while renaissance has sat on the sidelines 
 he succeeds roger <unk> who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua communications co. was no longer necessary 
 mr. evans will stay until a successor is found but not later than the end of the year the company said 
 it was the <unk> mr. evans who had moved into the offices of mgm\/ua and run the company during qintex australia ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company 
 on oct. N qintex entertainment was about to default on a $ N million payment owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program 
 but early on oct. N the second of two hectic days of board meetings mr. evans said he believed qintex australia would n't be <unk> 
 he recommended that the company file for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code before the mca deadline according to a source familiar with the sessions 
 later in the day according to the source the board reversed itself decided to file for bankruptcy protection and asked mr. evans to stay on

 the sept. N tracking travel column advises readers to charge with caution when traveling abroad because credit-card companies charge N N to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars 
 in contrast to the N N conversion fee charged by visa foreign-currency dealers routinely charge N N or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency 
 on top of this the <unk> who <unk> his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion 
 at the end of the trip any <unk> foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars with another commission due 
 typically he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill 
 in the meantime the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder often more than N N during that float period alone

 assets of the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's money fund report jumped to $ N billion in the week ended tuesday the <unk> <unk> newsletter said 
 meanwhile the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a <unk> of a percentage point the largest drop since <unk> 
 money funds invest in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring 
 the average maturity of the taxable funds that donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to N days its longest since august 
 they 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them slowly said walter frank chief economist for the donoghue organization publisher of money fund report 
 average maturity was as short as N days at the start of this year when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward 
 the average 30-day simple yield slid to N N from N N and the average 30-day compound yield fell to N N from N N 
 these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk 
 it 's a good strategy in a rising market where a N N leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have N N of their money working for them 
 share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold in the junk market he says 
 leverage is never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all 
 the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds 
 with a leveraged position of about N N the fund 's share price has plunged N N so far this year 
 that 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio whose total return <unk> changes plus interest has amounted to a negative N N 
 if someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold says gerald <unk> editor of the mutual fund letter in chicago they might shy away 
 if the market <unk> holders can make that much more profit the leverage effectively acts as an <unk> margin account for investors 
 but when the market moves against the fund investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged 
 carl <unk> who runs the colonial intermediate high income fund says the fund 's N N leverage has <unk> up its interest income 
 as long as i am borrowing at N N and each bond yields over that it <unk> the yield he maintains 
 new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ N million in preferred stock and notes from investors 
 we are trying to increase our flexibility says <unk> e. terry a vice president at <unk> capital management the fund 's investment adviser 
 ms. terry did say the fund 's recent performance illustrates what happens in a leveraged product when the market does n't cooperate 
 several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders fund officials said 
 prospect street high income portfolio for instance now holds about N N in cash and equivalents nearly <unk> the amount it held earlier this year says john <unk> portfolio <unk> 
 he says the fund which is N N leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds 
 at the <unk> zenith income fund portfolio manager john <unk> recently dumped mesa petroleum <unk> and <unk> industries among others to raise his cash position to a record N N 
 we 're looking at the leverage factor every day says robert moore president of <unk> inc. a shearson lehman hutton inc. unit and the fund 's adviser 
 at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost and at the moment we 're right on it we 're going to have to make a move 
 one of the more bizarre garden stories since <unk> has been <unk> for four years now in the private <unk> <unk> of artist <unk> bartlett 
 and if she and the battery park city authority have their way her <unk> <unk> plan will soon go public as a real garden <unk> in the downtown complex 
 south gardens as the bartlett scheme is called will <unk> the last N acres of open space at the southwest tip of manhattan 
 created by an artist who <unk> her ignorance of plants and gardens south gardens as now planned will die from <unk> garden design 
 ms. bartlett 's previous work which earned her an international reputation in the <unk> art world often took gardens as its nominal subject 
 but for south gardens the grid was to be a <unk> network of <unk> or hedge walls with real plants inside them 
 as she put it in a N <unk> at the harvard graduate school of design i have designed a garden not knowing the difference between a <unk> and a <unk> 
 moreover she proclaimed that landscape architects have been going wrong for the last N years in the design of open space 
 and she further stunned her <unk> by <unk> her secret garden design method <unk> a friend to spend five or six thousand dollars on books that i ultimately cut up 
 this was never a problem with south gardens because the client had long since given in to ms. bartlett 's every <unk> 
 last year the public was <unk> a <unk> of ms. bartlett 's creation in a <unk> version at a <unk> exhibition 
 she ordered the <unk> done in a different <unk> <unk> and made the landscape architects study a book on <unk> 
 next door she put a smaller <unk> glass house where she suggested a flat of <unk> might be displayed in the dead of winter 
 in another <unk> called the <unk> <unk> N <unk> trees were to be crowded together at killing <unk> of N or N feet 
 one thing about the bartlett plan was never in doubt it would demand the full-time skills of a <unk> of topiary <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 furthermore she had insisted on <unk> so narrow five to eight feet and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment trucks or cherry pickers could n't maneuver 
 then to make these <unk> quite literally rooms ms. bartlett had thrown up <unk> walls brick <unk> hedge eight to N feet tall casting her <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it was hard to see how <unk> would ever happen in south gardens without <unk> the walls in a <unk> array of <unk> 
 she ran it the length of the south gardens <unk> <unk> out the city 's great natural water features the harbor and the river 
 the parks council wrote the bpca that this too private exclusive complex and expensive <unk> garden belongs in almost any location but the <unk> 
 it seems to me the bpca plan has the potential of making south gardens a <unk> jail for people and plants 
 the three urban <unk> experts with cornell cooperative extension weighed in with a letter to the bpca that began we feel that the garden is <unk> doomed 
 the N <unk> hedges which <unk> views in and out of small rooms insure that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime 
 despite the dire <unk> of knowledgeable garden professionals ms. bartlett 's south gardens design somehow continues on seemingly <unk> to reason stalled only by bureaucratic <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 after four years of no progress in this direction it is doubtful any viable collaboration with ms. bartlett will suddenly now be possible 
 there is still time however for gov. mario <unk> or <unk> <unk> chairman of the bpca board to prevent this topiary <unk> <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is incorrect when he states that the soviet union 's large gold reserves would give it great power to establish credibility 
 the bank of england on the other hand had gold reserves that averaged about N N of its outstanding currency and bank of england notes were accepted throughout the world 
 by contrast in <unk> russia an <unk> government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose much as it would in today 's soviet union 
 the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for <unk> the currency 
 the soviet union should keep these <unk> in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency

 securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing circuit breakers to halt program trading at volatile times 
 after the study the sec would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or <unk> the current ones he added 
 circuit breakers designed to give the markets a <unk> in cases of sharp price movements curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points 
 at certain points during the friday the 13th drop circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market slowing trading at times 
 mr. breeden backed most of the provisions in a <unk> bill that the sec brought to the subcommittee last year under <unk> david <unk> 
 but the new chairman <unk> opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress 
 he argued that the current <unk> system allows investors to know precisely when and where any trading <unk> will occur and how long they will last 
 such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms

 so much of the stuff poured into its austin texas offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it 
 businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore literally 
 while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing 
 according to the direct marketing association total direct mail to both businesses and consumers jumped N N to N billion pieces in N from five years earlier 
 the <unk> has spurred <unk> companies to action with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it 
 it 's almost impossible to track the number of companies <unk> junk mail since the decision is usually made in the mail room not the board room 
 motorola 's austin operation was one of the first to lose patience deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual

 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today 
 although the proposal <unk> by mr. packwood and sen. william roth r. del. appears to have general backing by republicans their votes are n't sufficient to pass it 
 and democrats who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the <unk> cut are finding reasons to say no at least for now 
 president bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house 
 and at a <unk> meeting tuesday of democratic senators there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year according to participants 
 there is a <unk> shot of getting it this year said sen. david boren of oklahoma a leading democratic <unk> of cutting the capital-gains tax 
 another significant factor in the <unk> debate is the extent to which it has become a <unk> political battle between president bush and senate majority leader mitchell 
 today sen. mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to <unk> the proposal 
 white house officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <unk> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck sen. mitchell 
 as a result the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with senate democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut

 the company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans 
 but what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and <unk> unions the pilots and machinists 
 some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ N billion buy-out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups 
 united pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike said an executive at fuji bank one of ual 's large lenders 
 if you have both labor groups on strike you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at 
 another reason <unk> by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs 
 the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts 
 that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work 
 there 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions said richard nye of baker nye investments a new york takeover <unk> 
 both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like 
 the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> declared yesterday 
 on the other hand the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle saying they do n't think employees should be owners 
 we may be able to reach a <unk> where we can accommodate the pilot union 's concerns and <unk> said brian m. freeman the machinists ' financial adviser 
 if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists 
 who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union asks <unk> <unk> an analyst at wertheim <unk> & co 
 ms. <unk> says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots <unk> on their demand for control 
 she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control 
 another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the <unk> of the board through the solicitation of <unk>

 the results include a $ N million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value 
 thrift officials said the $ N million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of <unk> and market conditions 
 the adjustments result from the recently passed <unk> bailout legislation which requires thrifts to <unk> all high-yield bond investments by N 
 previously columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices because it held the bonds as long-term investments 
 because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices

 one day last march cbs sports president neal pilson and olympics <unk> barry frank met for lunch at the <unk> club here 
 mr. frank told mr. pilson that olympics officials wanted $ N million or more for tv rights to the N winter games in norway 
 at that price cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug. N 
 then he asked mr. pilson to raise his offer anyway if we can have a number that starts with a three you can have a <unk> 
 mr. pilson and his team <unk> in a <unk> and took just N minutes to return with a $ N million offer 
 but mr. pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid 
 cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong 
 abc a unit of capital cities\/abc inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. also risk losses if they <unk> cbs for other contracts 
 if they ask advertisers to absorb the costs they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports above all 
 at the same time some sports events will move off free television and onto cable or <unk> where half the nation 's tv homes ca n't see them 
 cbs has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it 
 some tv people doubt they will <unk> and argue that even if they do they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that cbs could run up 
 as we 've seen in the '80s says roger werner the president of the espn sports channel those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work 
 and three years later in a sea of red ink the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do 
 on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the olympic winter games in both N and N pilson bid a total of $ N billion 
 after N the winter and summer olympics will be held two years apart with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in N and the summer games in N 
 what happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports says peter <unk> a former cbs sports president now at <unk> inc 
 in the mid-1980s after abc had just bid a record $ N million for the N winter games he <unk> at rivals for paying reckless prices 
 i love pilson but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and <unk> says robert <unk> a former cbs sports president 
 rivals <unk> at the principle of pilson as nbc 's arthur watson once put it he 's always <unk> that rights are too high then he 's going crazy 
 a yale law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency 
 mr. pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property 
 then in may N mr. tisch <unk> needed to make a bold statement to <unk> rumors that he might sell the network 
 mr. pilson gave him one he bid $ N million for rights to the N winter games in <unk> france abc and nbc would n't bid even $ N million 
 the major events strategy mr. pilson says is designed to <unk> a place for cbs on the crowded tv dial of the 1990s 
 next october cbs for the first time wo n't have to start the season against the <unk> american and national baseball league <unk> and the world series 
 even if baseball <unk> losses at cbs and he does n't think it will i 'd rather see the games on our air than on nbc and abc he says 
 regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and <unk> new shows is a <unk> shoot mr. pilson says 
 but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences N N or N N larger than those cbs usually gets 
 mr. pilson says baseball and the olympics may help cbs move up to no. N in the household ratings race putting <unk> back into the network 's image 
 and the winter olympics will air during the february <unk> when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations 
 it 's made me more committed to cbs says philip a. jones the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group which has two cbs affiliates 
 in this market of N channels sophisticated viewers and the <unk> control trial is n't a guarantee of anything espn 's mr. werner says 
 during the N summer games for example abc touted call to glory but the military drama was missing in action within weeks 
 though cbs might move up to no. N in household ratings most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged N to N 
 but cbs will put the athletes up against bill cosby <unk> and other shows in nbc 's no. N schedule 
 the world series seven nights was n't enough of an incentive says arnold <unk> of <unk> in rochester which dropped cbs for nbc six weeks ago 
 on the $ N billion baseball agreement alone cbs is likely to lose $ N million in four years contends mr. <unk> the former cbs man now at comsat inc 
 mr. pilson calls that loss estimate wildly inaccurate <unk> only that cbs will lose money on baseball in the first year 
 cbs will pay an average of $ N million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season 
 it also indicates a $ N million drop in ad sales for regular-season games a risk cbs took to get an unprecedented lock on all <unk> games 
 moreover there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably from the <unk> price says arnold chase of bozell inc 
 it aired N hours of mostly live events in calgary helping raise ratings slightly from N but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers 
 cbs will add N N hours to that load in N and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events 
 all prime-time fare will be on <unk> because of time differences with norway so the results can be announced on the N <unk> news 
 turner broadcasting will pay cbs $ N million to air N hours of cbs coverage plus N hours of additional events 
 barry frank the agent who took mr. pilson to lunch last march says that even if cbs loses say $ N million it matters little 
 moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed <unk> says david j. stern the commissioner of the national basketball association 
 this is n't <unk> bidding this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it 
 and cbs takes in the least money in prime time abc and nbc charge N N to N N more for ads according to a variety survey 
 but cbs 's costs are huge and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs <unk> up 
 although sports officials predict <unk> of N N to N N in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only N N 
 cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time 
 cbs may cushion losses with about $ N million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling cbs records and other businesses 
 what you 're really asking is are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he says

 new technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work says <unk> goldman a staff attorney at the american civil <unk> union 
 on the corporate side companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service 
 the practice is common at catalog insurance and phone companies banks and <unk> according to trade groups and worker organizations

 that and other fancy <unk> may cost thousands but simple <unk> tape recorders sell for as little as $ N at electronics stores like radio shack 
 concerned with the increased availability of <unk> technology and heavier use of it lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue 
 and four states california florida michigan and pennsylvania have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded 
 in may rep. don edwards d. calif introduced congressional legislation that would require an <unk> <unk> during any employee monitoring warning people that they are being heard

 john <unk> a nynex spokesman says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job

 nine to five a <unk> office workers organization that supports the <unk> bill six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses 
 meanwhile supporters of the <unk> <unk> consent bill say it is needed because of a giant <unk> in the <unk> consent law

 ibm 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating they have risen N N to N N 
 but the N line is nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in N 
 ibm armonk n.y. said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year 
 the fourth quarter is always ibm 's biggest by far with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end

 will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies 
 in fact it 's barely begun for mr. corry who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job 
 he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at painewebber inc

 i do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry 
 he served as mr. roderick 's front man in <unk> negotiations for the N purchase of marathon oil for $ N billion

 one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside usx except dave roderick who was a hunting and fishing buddy of william l. <unk> chairman of texas oil & gas 
 what <unk> many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for $ N billion of stock doubled the usx shares outstanding and considerably diluted them 
 what 's more the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years 
 mr. corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to <unk> mr. icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value 
 that would leave usx with marathon its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products 
 the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned 
 mr. icahn has long believed associates say that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion is worth $ N a share if broken up 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N giving mr. icahn 's N million shares a value of $ N billion 
 unlike his predecessor who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry tends to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say 
 in the past five years usx has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs 
 dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says 
 indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer 
 the time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends 
 about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds 
 with mr. icahn breathing down his neck however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> tax-loss <unk> 
 right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets 
 one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's intentions 
 and then he wo n't panic says j. bruce johnston a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh

 farmers home administration <unk> loans have turned into de <unk> <unk> programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ N billion 
 <unk> 's findings are particularly troubling because the fha has about $ N billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs 
 scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape 
 secondary guarantees of pools of fha and <unk> loans by the agency known as ginnie mae currently exceed $ N billion 
 although external events have contributed to the <unk> the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs 
 for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and <unk> problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral 
 high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high 
 families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates 
 in contrast a student loan program that was meant solely to correct <unk> <unk> would allow loans for any student regardless of family income at market or <unk> rates 
 while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance 
 this program combined with cash grants to <unk> students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries 
 for example the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program 
 since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the <unk> of <unk> are usually low 
 in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off 
 simple policy <unk> in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the <unk> off contracted collection agencies and to deny new credit to <unk> 
 these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market <unk> 
 loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the <unk> defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government 
 by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit 
 predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion 
 this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees 
 many agencies roll over their debt paying off <unk> loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans 
 some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as N the <unk> bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to cuba in the 1950s 
 the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits 
 establishing these practices would permit earlier <unk> of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and <unk> decisions and reduce fraud 
 government lending was not intended to be a way to <unk> spending figures hide fraudulent activity or provide large subsidies 
 the reforms described above would provide a more limited but <unk> safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender

 city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday 's earthquake 
 but in spite of a <unk> <unk> gridlock never materialized mainly because the bay area rapid transit subway system carried N N more passengers than normal 
 moreover the two main bridges still connecting san francisco with the east bay did n't charge <unk> allowing traffic to zip through without <unk> 
 officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours or that many workers are still staying at home 
 in the best of times the bay bridge is the worst commute in the region often experiencing <unk> of N to N minutes or more 
 storm flooding caused <unk> on the freeway and many commuters had to find <unk> to bart 's stations because parking lots were full before <unk> 
 her commute from <unk> calif. normally takes an hour and N minutes via the golden gate bridge which <unk> san francisco with the north bay area

 <unk> kasparov went to combat sunday with the world 's most advanced <unk> computer and kicked it around <unk> anyway like an old <unk> can 
 playing black in the first game the human champion <unk> deep thought known for its attacking <unk> into a totally passive position 
 and in the second game with mr. kasparov advancing <unk> as white d.t. offered <unk> resistance and lost even faster 
 though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> soviet to beat the <unk> computer he gave the machine a far worse <unk> than many expected 
 as if he were iron mike about to enter the ring with a <unk> <unk> he declared i 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years 
 the computer 's mind is too straight too <unk> lacking the <unk> and creativity needed to reach the top he said 
 its chief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> for its tactical <unk> at <unk> out of horrible positions 
 in fact d.t. never left home <unk> mellon university in pittsburgh but <unk> with its human <unk> by telephone link 
 they conceded that the odds favored mr. kasparov but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for <unk> positions up to a million per second from N 
 no human can examine millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his <unk> powerful brain consistently found very good ones 
 after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which nigel short of great britain fought the champion to a draw in N 
 but the computer did n't play mr. short 's ninth move a key pawn thrust and its position deteriorated rapidly 
 instead of <unk> a standard measure to <unk> the king d.t. made a <unk> <unk> maneuver at move N then it put a knight <unk> on move N 
 <unk> usually are worth slightly more than <unk> but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's surviving <unk> was reduced to <unk> 
 when most <unk> thought its position <unk> the computer thought it was only in effect one-half of a pawn down 
 such <unk> met with <unk> and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have prompting more <unk> 
 while d.t. <unk> its king back and forth in a defensive <unk> mr. kasparov <unk> the knight to a dominant <unk> 
 now with the crowd in the analysis room <unk> <unk> blood the only question seemed to be how fast mr. kasparov could win game two 
 with the advantage of playing white which moves first mr. kasparov followed up <unk> against the computer 's defense a queen 's <unk> accepted 
 as early as move six mr. kasparov <unk> from a well-known <unk> of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard <unk> attack against the computer 's advanced knight 
 this left the computer with a broader range of <unk> replies and it immediately <unk> by moving a <unk> pawn to the <unk> of <unk> development 
 in such positions he explained you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now 
 and when a defensive move was called for d.t. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats 
 on a demonstration board <unk> <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice no <unk> <unk> this line of play 
 he won d.t. 's queen for two minor pieces and two <unk> not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope 
 reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in 
 in may N dr. blumenfeld gave merrill lynch & co. about $ N for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than N N 
 yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about N N and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than N N 
 instead his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value 
 now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance 
 the <unk> came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd 's estimated current market value had plummeted by $ N in a month 
 yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things says john <unk> research director of the american association of individual investors a chicago-based educational group 
 the biggest problem we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in 
 but he says he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks 
 the broker thomas <unk> of merrill lynch 's morristown n.j. office refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to merrill lynch officials in new york 
 those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale 
 <unk> involving zero-coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant 
 dr. blumenfeld says he does n't remember the <unk> about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium 
 federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation to a maximum of $ N 
 it 's not a blanket commitment it 's a <unk> situation says albert <unk> a managing director of merrill lynch money markets inc 
 merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in N 
 zero-coupon cds are only a small portion of the $ N <unk> in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total 
 but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured 
 people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed 
 however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid

 as conferees noted scarce capital means the costs of control must be <unk> through a broad <unk> of compliance choices for individual firms 
 that means simple clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction deferring more complex issues such as risk 
 it also means use of <unk> pollution limits such as <unk> permits rather than <unk> limits such as <unk> fees 
 while polish data have been freely available since N it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information

 these <unk> so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost <unk> to challenge them 
 if i were to ask a sample of american parents do you wish the <unk> schools to encourage creativity in your children the <unk> answer would be yes of course 
 the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual <unk> is matched only by their good opinion of themselves 
 fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands 
 american education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to prevail over the <unk> that we also share 
 it is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in <unk> development and even <unk> to minimize those <unk> tests with often disappointing results 
 it also provides teachers with a superior <unk> as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy 
 they may not be among the best and <unk> of their generation there are very few such people by definition 
 it is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more 
 it is also the kind of libel politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency 
 if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do 
 there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of <unk> and they are all sending us the same message 
 they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional <unk> since this is the least controversial option that is open to them 
 thus at the recent governors ' conference on education gov. bill clinton of arkansas announced that this country needs a comprehensive <unk> policy for children under five 
 we know that very early exposure to <unk> improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly <unk> away 
 let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work parental involvement is a bad idea 
 they should see to it that their kids do n't play <unk> they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing <unk> they should <unk> the report card 
 locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the <unk> of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably <unk> local politicians or would-be politicians 
 decades of educational research tell us <unk> that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the <unk> though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons

 thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities which were reduced by $ N billion in august from the prior month 
 i think we are going to see deposit <unk> continue unless we see big changes in rates mr. <unk> said 
 the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly <unk> the rate of economic growth 
 since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the <unk> for the productivity ratios calculated by the department of labor underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics 
 but i had expected more which is one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates 
 the <unk> of growth is due largely to the conservative <unk> adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data 
 the federal productivity <unk> use labor input rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well 
 because finance and services contribute N N to final business product missing these productivity improvements <unk> the overall growth rate by N N a year 
 in other words the growth rates of both total gnp and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about N N 
 union carbide corp. said third-quarter net income plunged N N from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business 
 net was $ N million or N cents a share for the quarter compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 but the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on wall street 
 it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company 's chief markets said george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co 
 prices for polyethylene a common plastic and an important carbide product started to fall early this year the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories 
 the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective

 up to now drexel has made a <unk> series of settlements with N states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
 just yesterday new hampshire announced it made a $ N settlement with drexel a <unk> fine for a <unk> matter in that state 
 these states have been entering into settlements with drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted <unk> 
 but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri 
 they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small <unk> firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely <unk> 
 drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be <unk> and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt 
 it already has sold its retail or <unk> brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for <unk> activities such as investment banking 
 still if nothing else a <unk> brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could be involved 
 securities regulators <unk> drexel for its energetic effort led by <unk> general counsel saul s. cohen to settle its legal problems with the states 
 the question she said is whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony 
 similarly alfred <unk> new hampshire 's director of securities regulation said his state had n't received any complaints about drexel so it really could n't press the issue 
 mr. cohen the drexel general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses 
 asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them 
 mr. cohen said more than $ N million has been paid to N states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ N million 
 the rate we 're going i think that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said 
 the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry 
 there are according to several securities commissioners at least N states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling 
 drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state

 at a private dinner thursday drexel burnham lambert inc. chief executive frederick joseph delivered a <unk> message about the junk bond market to officials of prudential insurance co. of america 
 the dinner was a stark confirmation that N is the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market 
 amid the market <unk> even drexel which has the <unk> and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its <unk> 
 in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment-grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market to do so 
 since the end of last year junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds including <unk> treasury securities 
 the fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with more than $ N billion in junk financing 
 campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale 
 what i thought i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and <unk> enough quite <unk> which is not at all bad he says 
 what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden <unk> that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds 
 unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs 
 at closely held <unk> securities corp. junk bond money managers <unk> k. <unk> and <unk> h. <unk> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary <unk> 
 in recent months they say there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them 
 mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced <unk> redemptions by shareholders <unk> said 
 investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as rjr holdings corp. and <unk> co. declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's <unk> 
 and <unk> said buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation 
 ms. <unk> and ms. <unk> say they are managing their junk portfolios <unk> building cash and <unk> upgrading the overall quality 
 we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it 's something to be concerned about says james a. <unk> a managing director 
 the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year probably will <unk> some analysts say 
 if anything we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management 
 mr. cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds 
 mr. cornell says the junk market is no <unk> as drexel claimed but it also is n't a disaster as the <unk> say 
 despite the junk market 's problems drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals have n't found 
 during the past three weeks for example drexel has sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. uniroyal chemical continental air and duff & phelps 
 still the list of troubled drexel bond offerings <unk> that of any firm on wall street as does its successful offerings

 i guess i might have asked <unk> to leave but he drops so many good names we decided to let him stay says steven greenberg publisher of fame 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party 
 they even drop <unk> names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says mr. <unk>

 he <unk> toyota and nissan motor co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models rather than simply adding more <unk> to their standard car lines

 he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with <unk> 
 japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. have focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition 
 consumers will be able to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the <unk> benefits the high-tech medium offers 
 otherwise they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs

 the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the recruit co <unk> scandal that plagued the ruling party last year 
 pachinko is slightly on the <unk> side often linked to the lower ranks of japan 's <unk> and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax <unk> 
 recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe 
 and because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers estimate the real income could be as much as N trillion yen 
 then in N a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was <unk> in parliament 
 the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national <unk> north koreans oppose the plan while south koreans japanese and taiwanese accept it or are neutral 
 but the press kept it alive as with the recruit scandal lists began circulating with names of people who had received money 
 within a matter of weeks <unk> magazines reported that members of the ruling ldp had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations 
 on friday the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry including N yen $ N by prime minister <unk> <unk> 
 direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations 
 the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese 
 many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would <unk> to politicians the way many japanese do to win favor or support

 and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about N N N 
 mr. durkin doubts that there is some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income indicates economic problems 
 the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income though up a bit has n't climbed <unk> and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed 
 moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. durkin says 
 he notes that some revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing 
 in addition he says longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of <unk> and the accompanying payment burden 
 so it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> at banks remain as the chart shows <unk> below some earlier highs see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N

 although working women are forced to wear the uniform of the day to retain their <unk> they are buying better quality more upscale intimate apparel he said 
 although mr. brawer 's appointment as president was long expected the move on sept. N <unk> the resignation of alan lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising 
 three days later mr. lesk was named president and chief executive officer of <unk> co. a competing intimate apparel division of <unk> inc 
 but maidenform officials say that after spending N years at maidenform mr. lesk N made it clear he wanted the top job 
 it was then split into <unk> apparel inc. the intimate apparel division and <unk> family products corp. which makes <unk> <unk> items and other products 
 publicly traded <unk> corp. which owns <unk> fair and <unk> lee corp. which owns <unk> co. are also strong forces in intimate apparel 
 buy-out offers for maidenform are n't <unk> says executive vice president david c. <unk> but they are n't taken very seriously 
 mr. brawer along with mrs. coleman and her daughter elizabeth an attorney who is vice chairman are the family members involved in the operations of maidenform which employs about N 
 the company has N plants and distribution facilities in the u.s. puerto rico other parts of the caribbean and ireland 
 before joining maidenform in N mr. brawer who holds a <unk> degree in english from the university of chicago taught at the university of wisconsin 
 as a senior vice president he has headed the company 's designer <unk> division <unk> de la <unk> since its inception in N 
 while the company has always been <unk> mr. brawer is n't the first person to <unk> into the family and subsequently head maidenform

 china could <unk> its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the <unk> deficit 
 but before import growth slowed china 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves 
 china 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ N billion in june N from $ N billion the previous september 
 but this time china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> square killings june N 
 for example china 's <unk> income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist <unk> since june N 
 the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for china 's <unk> balance two of which are considered most likely 
 in addition economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china 's deteriorating political and economic environment 
 the western government report 's first scenario assumes a N N reduction in foreign borrowing and a N N <unk> in foreign direct investment 
 but in either case the report says china 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves which are used to finance the <unk> 
 in the first scenario the reserves would be exhausted next year and in the second they would be wiped out in N 
 <unk> also said it expects a considerable rise in N group profit from the N <unk> $ N million net in N 
 new <unk> investments inc. said it closed the acquisition of <unk> glass co. from <unk> co. a <unk> ill. maker of <unk> home products 
 <unk> a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and <unk> industries had sales last year of about $ N million 
 had he been a little less <unk> i 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the <unk> bar mr. brown says 
 like mr. brown they sometimes go to surprising <unk> to meet that <unk> corporate goal delivering the goods on time 
 the election which would bring the first major union to federal 's u.s. operations has <unk> new <unk> against devoted veterans such as mr. brown 
 it has also rattled federal 's strongly <unk> management which is already <unk> with <unk> <unk> operations and with falling profits 
 a union sooner or later has to have an adversary and it has to have a victory frederick w. smith federal 's chairman and chief executive says with <unk> 
 under federal transportation law a government mediator is attempting to <unk> the <unk> of tiger 's job <unk> into federal 's 
 depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among <unk> <unk> <unk> workers stock <unk> and flight <unk> 
 unions would have a <unk> effect on the whole culture of the company says bernard la <unk> a professor at ohio state university at columbus and a federal consultant 
 since founding the company the <unk> vietnam <unk> who is still only N years old has <unk> an <unk> of combat 
 the <unk> <unk> award the navy <unk> for a job well done is <unk> on federal 's workers who <unk> the call of duty 
 he also lets workers <unk> steam through an elaborate <unk> procedure and as a <unk> fly free in empty <unk> seats 
 such attitudes have given federal flexibility not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean 
 but though <unk> work as many as N hours a week during the autumn rush they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum <unk> 
 the operational freedom has also given federal a leg up on archrival united parcel service inc. the nation 's largest employer of united <unk> of <unk> members 
 because ups drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the <unk> say these <unk> packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late 
 although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems 
 it had <unk> in its attempt to get into asia where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes <unk> on certain routes 
 these and other problems squeezed federal 's profit margins last year to N N down from more than N N annually in the first half of the decade 
 in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal says 
 federal 's stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general <unk> of airline stocks analysts say 
 since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 there 's a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase 
 tiger itself was founded by a band of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> supplies over the <unk> from india to china during world war ii 
 when a large group of pilots once signed <unk> opposing <unk> and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company <unk> and dressed them down for challenging his authority 
 its N workers who had battled tiger 's management for years over <unk> were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically <unk> 
 soon after the merger moreover federal 's management asked tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement <unk> that they could be fired any time without cause or notice 
 and even some <unk> pilots say his <unk> and popularity among the many former military <unk> could be tough to beat 
 a lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against fred smith says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and union activist 
 mr. smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles ohio new york alaska asia and europe 
 furthermore mr. smith added our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice 
 they were willing to <unk> us because we had n't shown any <unk> any resistance says william <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> federal veteran 
 but though most of the N federal pilots are believed opposed it is unclear just how much their loyalty to mr. smith has been eroded 
 the fight has turned <unk> and among pilots at least has shattered the <unk> de corps that mr. smith worked so hard to build 
 the senate convicted u.s. district judge <unk> hastings of florida of eight impeachment articles removing the <unk> judge from his $ <unk> lifetime job 
 in N mr. hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ N bribe in a case before him the central charge on which the senate convicted him 
 with no floor debate the senate on friday voted N to <unk> mr. hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe five votes more than needed 
 he was found not guilty of three charges involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation 
 although mr. hastings had been acquitted by a jury lawmakers handling the prosecution in congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual 
 instead they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust <unk> of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases 
 mr. hastings was appointed to the federal bench by president carter in N and was one of the few black federal judges in the country 
 while he packed the senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case 
 in that context robert <unk> 's <unk> performance as the <unk> even <unk> veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most 
 over the first few weeks mancuso fbi has <unk> straight from the <unk> which is either a <unk> <unk> at <unk> or a lack of <unk> or both 
 last week a young black girl claimed she had been <unk> by a white police officer a la <unk> <unk> 
 in last week 's rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who exploit the case 
 what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s 
 this is not the mississippi burning scenario that <unk> his young colleagues kid you 've been reading classic <unk> too long mancuso says 
 and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk> 
 yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret crush on truth justice and the american way 
 executive producers steve sohmer and jeff <unk> and <unk> ken <unk> and steve <unk> have <unk> this show up to the breaking point 
 to start there 's always a crisis and someone always worries what if the press gets a hold of this 
 finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <unk> 
 and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the hell can you live with yourself he <unk> at a politician 
 where the hell are they <unk> <unk> live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump 
 you 're the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a murder it was a crime against <unk> 
 they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they 're <unk> it 
 it 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction all to add more <unk> to a script that 's already <unk> on <unk> 
 there is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where mancuso <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> to his dead partner david 
 asked to say a few words he pulls out his <unk> piece of paper and tries to talk but he 's too <unk> up to get the words out 
 investment letters now <unk> i really like to read them if i <unk> enough i 've found i 've no time left to <unk> them 
 texaco inc. has purchased an <unk> company in texas for $ N million its first major acquisition since its legal <unk> with pennzoil co. began more than four years ago 
 <unk> which holds properties in N oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves 
 this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base said chief executive officer james w. <unk> 
 texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said 
 eventually texaco which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with pennzoil for $ N billion in N 
 mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer 
 the change in expected cash distributions from the <unk> real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs said jay r. cohen <unk> executive vice president

 japan had an <unk> trade surplus of $ N billion for the first N days of october down from $ N billion a year earlier the finance ministry said

 <unk> ag 's chairman said the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to <unk> a raider 
 since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving ag a market value of about N billion belgian francs $ N billion 
 but mr. <unk> said a rescue also could involve <unk> mutual life insurance co. which owns N N of ag 
 worried by european community <unk> that will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services starting in <unk> insurers are rushing to find partners and preparing for price wars 
 but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months 
 they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said 
 aside from generale de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a belgian savings bank and various family interests 
 a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control 
 he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term 
 however the panama episode has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues 
 the problem with this administration i think is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the nsc 
 in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as <unk> members 
 but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide 
 in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about N from about N in N administration officials say 
 but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc <unk> most experienced in latin america <unk> briggs was gone 
 but just as every previous nsc adviser has gen. scowcroft now will have to <unk> at what point the nsc staff becomes too lean and too <unk> 
 frank lavelle who at the time was the marketing director for sperry in <unk> fla. admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <unk> <unk> the navy official 
 mr. <unk> who left the navy in N pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy bribery and <unk> charges 
 the bribery scheme took place between N and N according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with mr. lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in <unk> va 
 court documents filed by prosecutors indicate mr. <unk> tried to steer to sperry a <unk> dollar contract to <unk> maintenance of certain navy electronics <unk> 
 mr. <unk> among other things illegally provided mr. lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give sperry an unfair advantage in the competition the documents said 
 charles <unk> a former unisys vice president and james neal a former company consultant have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes 
 he <unk> the contest on larry king 's radio show on pat <unk> 's television show and on the <unk> cable television network 
 he talked about it in every speech he made as he <unk> the country promoting his books which <unk> handy <unk> advice on using government information for fun and profit 
 and in addition to the $ N he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat <unk> and offered each of two <unk> $ N 
 to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who <unk> her boss 
 mr. lesko who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats 
 maybe americans are just so <unk> with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while 
 ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties 
 ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets 
 some european analysts speculated that officials of saab 's highly profitable <unk> truck operation balked at <unk> any of their <unk> 
 meanwhile ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market 
 jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm <unk> up by the end of the month

 up in his stadium box their new and controversial owner <unk> jerry jones watches <unk> as the team <unk> up to the <unk> line 
 so key in fact that mr. jones signed him in april for $ N million over the next six years a record for a <unk> 
 with three minutes left on the <unk> mr. <unk> takes the <unk> steps back and fires a <unk> pass straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back 
 at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone 
 last year the top N players on each nfl team took home an average $ N a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball 
 <unk> draft picks have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ N this year up N N from N

 an arkansas native he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national championship 
 after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego <unk> 
 years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock 
 so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk> 
 seven games and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old 
 he continues to <unk> the team trading <unk> running back <unk> walker to the minnesota <unk> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks 
 but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit 
 it 's simple says <unk> hunt who owns the kansas city chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ N to an average $ N 
 mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury suites <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium 
 the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold 
 he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games 
 mr. jones whose <unk> voice and <unk> ways <unk> an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days 
 besides signing mr. <unk> to a sizable contract mr. jones has agreed to pay <unk> <unk> steve <unk> $ N million over the next four years 
 details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability 
 most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old 
 this year the nfl also imposed an <unk> limit on teams going into training camp down from N in a move meant to trim payroll costs 
 owners say they expect the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings 
 in july N nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim <unk> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete <unk> 
 for his part jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that 
 to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to <unk> his staff in dallas 
 while the cowboys may not be the best investment now i do n't accept they ca n't be in the future 
 besides to a large extent mr. jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing 
 owning the cowboys has bought him <unk> to a <unk> life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n't provide 
 there is the new private jet the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the best parties and television appearances on shows such as prime time live 
 but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from <unk> about how badly the <unk> are <unk> is irrelevant

 it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to mr. <unk> 's opinions of their country

 one bond trader estimated that more than $ N million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone 
 municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health rumors of a $ N million bond offering coming soon and political uncertainty 
 although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold 
 new york one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds sold $ N million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago 
 there have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening as the october N stock market crash continues to make itself felt 
 rumors <unk> last week that new york 's credit ratings single-a from moody 's investors service inc. and <unk> from standard & poor 's corp. are at risk 
 the weakness in new york city bonds follows a warning from new york state comptroller edward <unk> that the N crash seriously weakened the city 's economy 
 new york city 's revised financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ N billion budget

 qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate qintex entertainment inc. filed for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 qintex entertainment is N N owned by qintex australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements 
 after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing qintex entertainment stock sank $ N in over-the-counter trading to close at $ N on heavy volume of more than N million shares 
 mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ N million in debt under its loan agreements 
 it 's a <unk> said joseph di <unk> chairman of <unk> capital securities a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment 
 qintex australia was going to pay more than $ N billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ N million 
 it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested 
 it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company said barry <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp

 <unk> utsumi vice minister for international affairs said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out 
 mr. utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out 
 still mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have <unk> or <unk> believed that the ministry played a role in <unk> recent moves by japanese banks 
 all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position 
 bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads 
 at a news conference this week bank of japan gov. <unk> <unk> cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals 
 while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game 
 despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts say 
 jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to <unk> the problem of not having a strong <unk> network 
 concerned by <unk> demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into <unk> cigarettes but also into electronic <unk> payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores 
 brown tobacco in france is a more <unk> stronger grade than the lighter grade or <unk> tobacco used in so-called <unk> cigarettes 
 we are n't philip morris cos. says <unk> de <unk> chairman of government-owned societe <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> & <unk> s.a. known as seita 
 last year for example seita 's net profit soared N N to N million french francs $ N million on sales of <unk> N billion a N N profit margin 
 instead he said in an interview he is looking for ways to exploit france 's network of N tobacco agents most of them <unk> 
 instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops 
 once <unk> the card would sit in the car 's window showing traffic <unk> how much time the <unk> could remain 
 when the <unk> returned to his car he could turn the card off and if it showed time remaining save it for later 
 it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french <unk> subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group bsn <unk> 
 <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just N N of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago 
 while seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france it is being hurt by rising imports and from <unk> cigarette demand 
 so seita has introduced <unk> cigarettes under the <unk> label and intends to <unk> the unsuccessful <unk> <unk> in new packaging similar to the <unk> used by <unk> <unk> 
 the aim says mr. de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade smokers who are switching to <unk> cigarettes to keep buying french 
 when the supreme court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving <unk> and false <unk> on their minds 
 but the N ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially <unk> as on abortion rights 
 in the missouri case <unk> consequences may have <unk> because the high court <unk> the preamble of the state 's N abortion law 
 the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws 
 last week when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals her lawyer also relied on the preamble 
 there 's no risk to the protesters and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are N people standing outside every day 
 that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court <unk> stopped short of <unk> roe vs. wade 
 the only reason that somalia remains in <unk> is numbers a <unk> <unk> <unk> of N million people spread out over an <unk> nearly the size of texas 
 up to N <unk> have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops 
 the <unk> details are only now emerging from a <unk> <unk> report based on hundreds of interviews with <unk> selected refugees 
 not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for <unk> as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks 
 <unk> years old and a <unk> scientific socialist president barre has a power base composed only of his minority <unk> <unk> that according to observers is narrowing 
 but due to dramatic events on the <unk> over the past few days and weeks those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as <unk> as the american runway 
 on sept. N i wrote on these pages about the killing and <unk> of N <unk> soldiers by <unk> and <unk> guerrillas 
 recently in <unk> province in the center of ethiopia <unk> forces have killed <unk> and captured an additional N government troops 
 think what these numbers mean considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance 
 mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <unk> from the <unk> 
 what this all means in <unk> is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is <unk> as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is 
 the state department to its credit has already begun <unk> itself from mr. barre <unk> by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored 
 what 's more the u.s. has suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid 
 because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the runway could go too 
 but as one expert tells me whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre 
 remember that it took mr. mengistu many months in what became known as the creeping coup to topple <unk> <unk> <unk> in N and N 
 but the u.s. has one great advantage the soviets are <unk> <unk> throughout ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade <unk> and all 
 it 's not just in eastern europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side but on the horn of africa as well 
 the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre and that should be cut fast

 opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets 
 output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out 
 as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent <unk> agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency 
 so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others 
 but that could change if demand for opec 's oil <unk> seasonally early next year as some think may happen 
 but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still exists within opec 
 most is concentrated in five persian gulf countries including his own <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister told the conference friday 
 even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi arabia and <unk> could upset the market 
 the <unk> oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act <unk> to maintain a stable market 
 however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member 
 under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system 
 at an <unk> geneva meeting late last month opec 's oil ministers <unk> approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling 
 they <unk> it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official <unk> 
 the main effect of the ceiling boost was to <unk> some of the <unk> already coming from the quota <unk> 
 previously no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target or ceiling 
 but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity advanced there in an iranian proposal was generally endorsed by the ministers 
 but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting 
 the ceiling would be lifted to N million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab <unk> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others 
 insisting on a N N share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro <unk> distribution of increases to all members 
 some of the proposed modifications since however call on saudi arabia to give back to the <unk> pool a <unk> N barrels

 general equity funds fell an average of N N in the week ended thursday compared with a N N slide for the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 but lipper analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have <unk> themselves from the stock market 's gyrations 
 <unk> funds for instance which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal posted an average decline of N N 
 global allocation funds take the <unk> concept one step further by investing at least N N of their portfolios outside the u.s. 
 this gives them the added benefits of international diversification including a foreign-exchange boost during periods like the past week when the dollar declines against other major currencies 
 with all that going for them global flexible portfolio funds declined only N N in the week through last thursday 
 thus even including the latest week the average general stock fund has soared more than N N so far this year the lipper analytical figures show 
 by comparison global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about N N while domestic flexible portfolios are up about N N 
 fixed-income funds have returned N N while gold funds which tend to be volatile have risen just N N on average 
 the $ N million <unk> fund for instance was the seventh top performing fund for the week with a N N return 
 by the time the market plummeted N days ago <unk> was N N in cash said robert <unk> president and portfolio manager 
 howard stein chairman of dreyfus corp. said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on oct. N and about N N in cash 
 many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas giving them the benefit of foreign currency <unk> when the dollar is weak 
 three international cash portfolios funds which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas were among the four <unk> funds in the latest week 
 because the funds ' investments are <unk> in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar 
 but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines 
 the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign said a. michael lipper president of lipper analytical

 the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has handed wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal 
 the short answer on a fundamental basis is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ N and $ N a share 
 that 's based on a multiple of anywhere between N to N times ual earnings which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ N a share this year 
 airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio which is currently about N times earnings 
 that 's because airline earnings like those of auto makers have been subject to the cyclical <unk> of the economy 
 by that logic the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the eventual price might be higher 
 the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ N million and to commit $ N million from their retirement funds

 investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they not the pilots must have control 
 one way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders 
 the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking 
 and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets first boston estimated the airline is worth $ N to $ N a share

 troubled saatchi & saatchi co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including interpublic group but has rejected them people familiar with the company said

 interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer philip <unk> jr. made the pitches in visits to mr. saatchi in london the executives said 
 but the spokesman confirmed that saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <unk> and <unk> units 
 analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company and their outlook at least for the short term is bleak 
 it rebuffed an offer by carl spielvogel head of saatchi 's backer spielvogel bates unit to lead a management buy-out of all or part of saatchi 
 and last week people close to saatchi said maurice saatchi and his brother charles would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged 
 but saatchi 's troubles have only <unk> up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses 
 <unk> for example has had big problems at its new york office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including minneapolis and chicago 
 that would would make it appealing to a network such as interpublic that already has a healthy new york presence 
 while there would be some client conflicts they would n't be nearly as onerous as with saatchi 's other agencies 
 <unk> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network it has billings of about $ N million and blue-chip clients including general mills <unk> and dow brands

 freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are <unk> out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation 
 trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport 
 major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years 
 that 's a big change from recent years when freight <unk> was a bright spot for u.s. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make u.s. industry more competitive abroad 
 shippers surveyed recently by ohio state university said they expect their <unk> storage and distribution costs to rise about N N this year 
 only N N of the N shippers polled expected their <unk> costs to decrease compared with N N who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years

 the u.s. is required to notify foreign <unk> if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives government officials said 
 the notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret N exchange of letters between the reagan administration and the senate intelligence committee 
 the existence of the guidelines has become known since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday 
 according to the officials mr. bush even read to the senators <unk> from a highly classified letter from the committee to the white house discussing the guidelines 
 they said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's panama coup effort 
 no notification was ever considered officials said apparently because the u.s. did n't think the coup <unk> intended to kill mr. noriega but merely sought to <unk> him 
 the <unk> was launched at a meeting between mr. bush and intelligence committee leaders oct. N a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules 
 however the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by nbc news is already being interpreted on capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress 
 the statement added someone has <unk> chosen to <unk> <unk> portions of highly classified <unk> between the two branches of government 
 not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust we have all worked to develop 
 sen. boren said it 's time to stop <unk> and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future 
 sen. boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate <unk> rules 
 but the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the white house by a <unk> congress 
 instead both congressional and administration officials agreed it grew out of talks about <unk> in panama that were initiated by the administration in july N and stretched into last october 
 one administration official said notification was required even if the u.s. gets wind of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life 
 one senior administration official called the guideline <unk> and said it could make u.s. <unk> reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble 
 the issue came to a head last year officials recalled partly because the reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new panama coup efforts 
 though the assassination ban is a white house order that congress never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation 
 the administration has reacted to criticism that it <unk> the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame congress for restrictions the white house said have hampered its freedom of action 
 however last week mr. webster 's two top cia deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in panama 
 nevertheless the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some <unk> with sens. boren and cohen after their oct. N meeting with the president

 inflation could be a real surprise said samuel d. <unk> chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc. in chicago

 in east germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader egon krenz 
 you have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an east german mother of two who <unk> <unk> political <unk> with her friends 
 mr. krenz does n't seem to be the <unk> <unk> many initially thought he was when the <unk> politburo member was selected last week to succeed erich honecker 
 for the first time in my life i was n't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television 
 although mr. krenz is dedicated to east germany 's conservative <unk> of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party <unk> 
 indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a <unk> machine factory on the <unk> of berlin and <unk> among the workers a la gorbachev 
 at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were <unk> the country because of restrictive travel policies 
 rather than trying to <unk> us says one congressional aide who attended the <unk> meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by mr. krenz 's ready admission that east germany needed to change 
 he 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to west german chancellor helmut kohl 
 born in a <unk> town in an area which is now part of poland he has dedicated his life to the party <unk> 
 he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his <unk> mr. honecker and emerged as the heir apparent 
 barbara <unk> an expert on east germany at radio free europe in <unk> says mr. krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true <unk> 
 even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party 's ruling politburo 
 and his relative youth could help him project a more <unk> image <unk> with the perception of mr. honecker as an <unk> old man

 but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the <unk> of <unk> atoms 
 of the N <unk> registered for the society 's <unk> meeting fewer than N sat through the day and a half of cold fusion <unk> at week 's end 
 neither of the two <unk> whose utah experiments triggered the cold fusion <unk> martin fleischmann and b. stanley pons were at the meeting 
 but some members of an ad <unk> expert committee set up by the department of energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience 
 most of the two dozen scientists taking the <unk> reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple <unk> experiments described last march by messrs. fleischmann and pons 
 when an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum <unk> the heavy water did begin to break up or <unk> 
 as of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar <unk> experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely 
 one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by richard a. <unk> professor of chemical engineering at the university of minnesota 
 mr. <unk> said his skepticism of the utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results 
 when it was <unk> heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said 
 the bursts often occur they said after they <unk> the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on 
 typically the input energy ranges from a third of a <unk> to one <unk> and the excess energy is measured in <unk> of a <unk> 
 one exception is a continuing experiment at stanford university where as much as N watts of energy are being put into the <unk> cells 
 one of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by <unk> john <unk> of texas <unk> university 
 mr. <unk> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of <unk> increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water 
 he said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak <unk> between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium 
 messrs. fleischmann and pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable 
 in subsequent experiments one of two <unk> detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but <unk> bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time

 bethlehem steel corp. ltv corp. and armco inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated <unk> steel 
 they note that most of the new plants will come on line in N when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports 
 he does add however that <unk> japanese car makers are boosting the levels of <unk> steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel 
 indeed usx said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach N million tons annually by N compared with N million tons shipped in N 
 usx already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called <unk> plant for such production 
 the company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to <unk> affect the company 's existing hot-dipped <unk> lines 
 one of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> more quickly 
 so here 's a <unk> of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges 
 and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer 
 market order this is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions 
 limit order limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment 
 investors do this by <unk> a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it 
 stop order stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level 
 once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get 
 while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above 
 the crash in october N and last friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do 
 unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit <unk> orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price 
 but if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price 
 <unk> order <unk> orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached 
 however unlike a <unk> order a buy <unk> order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell <unk> order is entered at a price above it 
 as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price 
 gregory <unk> who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed u.s. trading championship says he uses <unk> orders almost exclusively when trading options 
 if they do n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price 
 it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting 
 in a <unk> market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security 
 <unk> order this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time 
 day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered <unk> orders have no expiration date 
 they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel 
 investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences 
 so a stock with a beta of N is half as volatile one at N is N N more volatile and so on 
 beta is only part of the risk in a stock says william f. <unk> the stanford university <unk> professor who developed the measure 
 there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that 
 that business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and <unk> portfolio 
 in particular the prices of gold and other <unk> stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low <unk> because their moves are not <unk> 
 concern that investors could <unk> such <unk> led the american association of individual investors to eliminate beta figures for <unk> funds in the N edition of its mutual-fund guide 
 people tend to see risk primarily on that one <unk> says timothy <unk> national director of personal financial planning for accountants deloitte haskins & sells 
 but <unk> lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being <unk> by others 
 this is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like <unk> every night <unk> by <unk> of your money sitting <unk> in six-month cds 
 risk wears many <unk> and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be <unk> high in other less obvious kinds 
 but their value as investments can be <unk> by inflation which <unk> the purchasing power of bonds ' <unk> interest payments 
 stocks are much riskier than treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider 
 but investors who are <unk> with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and <unk> goals 
 for instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the N market crash last friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings 
 by retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement 
 that 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says steven b. <unk> a new york financial planner with seidman financial services 
 the portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a <unk> couple at age N illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider 
 for instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk 
 the younger couple 's <unk> involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue 
 but one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio 
 here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it 
 of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals 
 indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans 
 they may feel <unk> secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says john h. <unk> a financial planner with <unk> armstrong <unk> inc. in washington 
 over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like treasury bills 
 but while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself 
 and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past 
 he <unk> says he has been down on noriega for some time hence his criticism of administration <unk> of the attempted coup

 continued investment in my N <unk> has been part of my strategy figure N with present annual contributions now equaling more than N N of the car 's original value 
 expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to its suburban <unk> 
 i have thus committed sufficient personal <unk> to ensure that my grounds and <unk> will never be short of greens and flowers 
 at the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment <unk> has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning

 the median price of homes is $ N more than N vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest <unk> harbor 
 no wonder all kinds of big-time scams have <unk> here from phony <unk> <unk> sales to <unk> car dealers to <unk> <unk> traders 
 because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money <unk> <unk> operators really harvest 
 i 've heard that there is $ N billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year mr. <unk> says 
 that contrasts with the <unk> sales of things such as <unk> sets and office supplies that are known as hollywood scams 
 thus <unk> <unk> investors sent $ N million to the newport beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges 
 douglas jones an attorney representing richard o. kelly sr. the chairman and president of capital trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to <unk> investors 
 but says mr. katz the u.s. attorney the interesting thing about newport beach operations is that they give themselves the <unk> of beautiful offices with <unk> <unk> 
 when we go there it 's quite different from these hollywood places where the <unk> are spread out on the table and the people are picking their <unk> 
 it 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in las vegas mr. katz says 
 mr. <unk> has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that <unk> operators are not easily <unk> 
 richard <unk> president of the newport harbor area chamber of commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of

 the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools 
 but parents ' <unk> for a <unk> education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine 
 <unk> aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes 
 their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore 
 the calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of N N annually a rate historically <unk> by the individual in only one place the stock market 
 most of the <unk> are free but <unk> financial programs sells for $ N a version <unk> to the age of the child and the college of choice 
 to build a <unk> egg that would pay for stanford when a current <unk> reaches college age parents would need to set aside $ N a month for N years 
 and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital 
 using a recent average <unk> cost of about $ N a year t. rowe price 's planner <unk> $ N monthly if the plan begins when the child is six 
 since the formula assumes an N N <unk> return in a mutual fund there would also be $ N in taxes to pay over the N years 
 people are basically peddling a lot of fear says arthur <unk> a consultant to the american council on education in washington 
 he takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially

 mr. <unk> <unk> that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages 
 they have laid out about $ N billion for so-called <unk> zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by connecticut illinois virginia and eight other states 
 the prepaid plans take payment today usually at current <unk> or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow 
 the <unk> bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be <unk> for college <unk> 
 like other <unk> they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when junior graduates from high school 
 but richard anderson head of the forum for college financing alternatives at columbia university a research group partly financed by the federal government says <unk> are particularly <unk> 
 issuing states generally limit the guarantees to <unk> institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools 
 but buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so 
 one problem is that the internal revenue service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable 
 based on historical rates of return mr. anderson <unk> a N N stock portfolio <unk> to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century 
 florida and wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack 
 the state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs

 among the <unk> farmers in the <unk> delta land of <unk> county <unk> allen d. tharp of <unk> was one of the best known and most <unk> 
 he sold <unk> <unk> to stock other farmers ' <unk> and he bought back <unk> <unk> that he <unk> to market along with his own <unk> crop 
 along the way mr. tharp omitted a total of $ N million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years 
 unknown to mr. tharp he had <unk> his net on a special irs project to catch <unk> farmers and <unk> inclined to <unk> on their taxes 
 confronted with the evidence mr. tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ N and sentenced to N months in prison 
 irs statistics show that the more persistent <unk> of income among sole <unk> of businesses include <unk> dealers entertainment producers <unk> <unk> and taxi owners 
 once such abuses become so pervasive the irs builds another factor into its secret computer formula for <unk> returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them 
 san <unk> have a much higher <unk> of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because irs agents envy their life styles 
 many <unk> for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have <unk> so broadly that congress has passed <unk> laws to close them 
 <unk> <unk> income can be spotted by computer because a <unk> of <unk> who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's social security number 
 <unk> applicants now must give social security numbers enabling the irs to see whether americans living abroad are filing required u.s. returns 
 but while irs computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention 
 it prompted an irs study that found many sellers were <unk> income and treating large amounts of <unk> travel and other personal expenses as business costs mr. <unk> says 
 the study provided criteria for <unk> out returns of potentially <unk> taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a <unk> business 
 many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax <unk> and to continue to <unk> many expenses that employees ca n't 
 in his area mr. <unk> continues the <unk> employers most commonly are in construction doing <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar work 
 but a medical clinic with about N employees <unk> listed all of them including physicians and <unk> as independent contractors 
 it assessed nearly $ N against a <unk> company that carried about N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other employees as self-employed <unk> 
 thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out <unk> groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed new york income-tax returns 
 the department has collected over $ N million from brokers so far and recommended more than N of them for criminal prosecution 
 in finding good news in berkeley 's new freshman <unk> plan the <unk> class editorial sept. N you 're reading the headline but not the story 
 the plan indeed raises from N N to N N the number of <unk> applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria 
 in addition perhaps N N of <unk> will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category 
 the plan thus will decrease by N N for a net loss of N N the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria 
 the plan creates a new category of students from <unk> <unk> backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about N N of the class 
 one of the plan 's authors has defended the <unk> disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current <unk> preferences based on race 
 nor will students from <unk> groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the <unk> target for their group 
 the plan thus places a large new <unk> program based on <unk> disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race 
 do they really believe that the number is just for <unk> and is simply a <unk> on the road to being a <unk> winner 
 because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question how could i be so stupid 
 while the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because <unk> <unk> have become <unk> in american <unk> 
 other people are making it overnight and the rest who <unk> daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along 
 adds spencer <unk> branch chief for enforcement at the sec in fort worth texas why do people play the <unk> when the odds are great against them 
 clearly though <unk> artists have to be a bit more <unk> than simply promising millions the psychology of <unk> is n't simply the psychology of the greedy 
 so one popular <unk> is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing 
 at times salesmen may <unk> the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly <unk> slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says mr. <unk>

 still others are <unk> by a desire to do both well and good says douglas watson commanding officer of the los angeles police department 's <unk> division 
 but hardly the only ones the scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed <unk> families and prevent the disappearance of children 
 for instance salesmen may counter a man 's <unk> that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking who wears the <unk> in your family 
 or an investor who wants his <unk> 's advice may be told you seem like a guy who can make up his own mind 
 donald <unk> an attorney for the <unk> firm denies the fraud allegations and says the <unk> were fully <unk> that they were pursuing a high-risk investment

 in times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but <unk> is a <unk> family and accustomed to it 
 if all you want is <unk> coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits 
 but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires 
 even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older 
 there are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others 
 that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me 
 which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing 
 if i die early i win a <unk> victory since i ca n't enjoy it and if i live long the insurer wins 
 this is worth <unk> when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that <unk> cash value 
 the word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or <unk> it in <unk> <unk> to talk about savings and investment instead 
 the implication is that your <unk> policy is really some kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature 
 that 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package 
 i 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life 
 projecting the latter over several decades i find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long 
 also some policy <unk> assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of dividend bonus after the <unk> year 
 if interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for <unk> premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection 
 some insurers have also started offering <unk> bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for N years 
 but glenn daily a new york-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just <unk> because most are n't guaranteed by the companies 
 and the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments 
 also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling <unk> these advance payments from taxes 
 after one year i could walk away from the <unk> policy with $ N but <unk> get only $ N from the equitable 
 a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it

 net for the quarter ended sept. N fell to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 digital said a shift in its product mix toward <unk> products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins 
 a spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector 
 the lack of a strong product at the high end of digital 's line was a significant drag on sales 
 but analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly <unk> rise in the dow jones industrial average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength 
 margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship i 'm not sure it will be a big winner

 american telephone & telegraph co. unveiled a sweetened pension and <unk> program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ N million in the next year 
 at&t said its amended pension program will nearly double to N the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments 
 at&t said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program 
 net income rose to $ N million or N cents a share from the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share 
 under the amended pension program at&t managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes 
 managers who retire dec. N will have an additional N N added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age N whichever comes earlier 
 an at&t spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees

 westridge capital is an index fund the type of <unk> long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average 
 institutional investors have poured $ N billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns 
 and the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ N of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers 
 because <unk> managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points 
 among the <unk> indexing strategies <unk> portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the s&p N companies 
 with today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the s&p N 
 one reason for these <unk> is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain <unk> funds that mirror the s&p N 
 after <unk> in size in the past five years index funds now hold about N N of the stock owned by pension funds 
 <unk> funds have become so <unk> that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that 
 to land customers for their <unk> stock <unk> business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free 
 as a result <unk> have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money 
 mr. <unk> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in <unk> with options to boost returns and protect against declines 
 big <unk> bankers trust co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns 
 j. thomas allen president of <unk> advanced investment management inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the s&p N stocks and futures 
 prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p N index plus N of a percentage point 
 here a fund may promise to pay back say $ N of every $ N invested for a year even if the market goes much lower 
 the fund could invest $ N for one year in treasury bills yielding N N to return the guaranteed $ N 
 that leaves $ N which could be used to buy s&p N options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index 
 we see a lot of interest in those kind of things says frank <unk> a vice president of bankers trust 
 instead of <unk> the s&p N or some other index exactly some stocks are <unk> or <unk> in the portfolio 
 one simple approach is to exclude s&p N companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak <unk> but also can hurt when a company like chrysler corp. <unk> 
 indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in south africa 
 the big board reported that short interest dropped to N shares as of oct. N from N shares in <unk>

 polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for mr. courter 
 going into the 1990s the gop is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to <unk> democrats in the past 
 this change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the <unk> of the debate

 abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but new jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate 
 mr. courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident <unk> who defended oliver north before national cameras at iran-contra hearings two years ago

 consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate N N in september pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the labor department reported 
 energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs 
 the report was the <unk> news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than N points last friday 
 the climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned 
 they also said the dollar is <unk> off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods 
 i think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said joel <unk> a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here 
 because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep N N last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too 
 the bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very <unk> for a lot of businesses he said 
 the steep climb in producer prices reported last friday <unk> <unk> about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's N N plunge that day 
 in the past several days however the u.s. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets

 one of the major selling points used by los angeles financier alfred <unk> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds 
 mr. <unk> says that in the past banks would normally have <unk> N N of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets 
 another N N of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans 
 mr. <unk> 's purchase of nwa mr. <unk> notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at N N of the purchase price 
 his client mr. davis used just such a letter from citicorp in pursuing ual citicorp later agreed to work with a competing ual buy-out group 
 executives of citicorp and chase manhattan declined to comment on either the ual situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers 
 mark <unk> senior managing director at manufacturers hanover trust co. says the <unk> in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in <unk> takeovers 
 in fact manufacturers hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from <unk> loans to other banks dropped N N to $ N million 
 we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman 
 james b. lee head of <unk> and private <unk> at chemical banking corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of <unk> shopping for takeover finance 
 beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers 
 arthur <unk> jr. a takeover lawyer at fried frank harris <unk> & jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds 
 one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was paramount communications inc. in its initial offer to acquire time inc. for $ N billion or $ N a share 
 but some observers believe paramount chairman martin davis wanted to avoid the possible <unk> of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time 
 in the end mr. davis used junk bonds so that he could raise paramount 's bid to $ N a share 
 the success of the nwa financing and the failure of the ual deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks 
 japanese banks accounted for N N of the nwa bank debt according to a report by transportation secretary samuel skinner

 the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ N million or $ N a share

 the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector 
 charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said higher prices for galvanized and <unk> products offset lower prices for bar <unk> and structural steel 
 structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a N N price drop mr. bradford said 
 the company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs 
 the increased labor costs became effective aug. N under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the united steelworkers union 
 inland chairman frank w. <unk> said the company 's short-term outlook is <unk> by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets 
 however he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter 
 when things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately 
 however when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more <unk> it is the better its chance for survival 
 when that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake <unk> through the market and increased the market 's volatility 
 contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole 
 it is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news 
 market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is <unk> these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit 
 current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of <unk> who become extremely <unk> during times of crisis 
 but i am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty <unk> power to our nation 's markets 
 for the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy 
 some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession

 when they do hit they hit fast says david a. wyss chief financial economist at the data resources division of mcgraw-hill inc 
 but short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a <unk> price fairly soon 
 that means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a <unk> 
 when interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs 
 it 's an <unk> necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the <unk> says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at cornell university 
 municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government 
 but a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the <unk> 
 what 's more he thinks this could be a <unk> recession than usual once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse 
 because he sees a N N to N N base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon 
 instead mr. beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and treasury bills

 and in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios 
 most studies show that <unk> investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of N N to N N including both dividends and price appreciation 
 moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing 
 trying to time the economy is a mistake says david katz chief investment officer of value <unk> management inc. in new york 
 mr. katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about N N of the time to beat a <unk> strategy 
 and the <unk> might miss the sudden <unk> that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time 
 unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't <unk> be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases 
 mr. katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in <unk> to the company 's earnings per share 
 and in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as <unk> as they were sept. N N just before the crash 
 that ratio is <unk> close to the ratio of N that prevailed before the N stock-market crash mr. <unk> says

 figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of night train express most people have little trouble saying no to <unk> like this 
 but healthy skepticism <unk> when they are <unk> by an organized charity to help fight cancer <unk> child abuse or what have you 
 in fact the <unk> sometimes might be better off giving the money to the <unk> at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth 
 in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a <unk> of cash was left for the <unk> beneficiaries 
 it 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity <unk> is <unk> by <unk> fund-raising costs <unk> operators and downright fraud 
 state law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from <unk> groups such as the council of better business bureaus are not encouraging 
 without a <unk> and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out <unk> causes from <unk> if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself 
 on this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says david <unk> an assistant attorney general in connecticut 
 including those he contends who put about $ N million into the <unk> for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center 
 the telephone number for the charity in <unk> conn. has been <unk> and the former officials could n't be located 
 running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed 
 the <unk> foundation the american cancer society and the united way of america all say that they spend roughly N N of their income on programs not overhead

 the state of illinois is suing the charity for fraud in chicago along with <unk> marketing inc. its <unk> fund <unk> 
 the charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a <unk> base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come 
 enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising 
 it has ruled that such laws might work to <unk> fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' <unk> right to freedom of expression 
 this puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or <unk> and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently 
 but the total value of the prizes was only $ N and most winners will receive just N cents according to the attorney general 's office 
 there are so many <unk> <unk> used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all 
 the solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign <unk> and <unk> the public about some health or other issue 
 all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as do n't smoke or wear <unk> <unk> says william webster attorney general of missouri 
 many <unk> charities ride the <unk> of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs

 the illinois attorney general won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without <unk> 's permission 
 british airways plc a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of ual corp. <unk> its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of united airlines 
 in addition british air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a <unk> statement that said the original deal is closed 
 the carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for ual 
 however company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to <unk> the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making 
 however in response to the british air decision united 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out 
 ual chairman stephen m. wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal 
 in another setback yesterday united 's <unk> union asked the treasury department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws 
 in an effort to <unk> the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the securities and exchange commission transportation department and labor department 
 the united <unk> union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake 
 the pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision <unk> our belief that an <unk> owned airline is practical and <unk> 
 ual stock dropped $ N yesterday to $ N on volume of N shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 in an interview wednesday with dow jones professional investor report mr. stevens said we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all 
 indeed british air seemed to be <unk> itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment 
 the buy-out consortium <unk> to exist because our american partners were not capable of organizing the financing a british air spokesman said 
 most of the department 's statements since the northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in u.s. carriers

 but senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday 
 afterward leaders of the dissident democrats <unk> and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned 
 the decision is a setback for president bush who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the <unk> senate 
 still sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year 
 he said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the democratic leadership might <unk> 
 yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year 
 mr. mitchell 's first victory came last week when the senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision 
 that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by house and senate negotiators 
 the president apparently will have only one bill to push sen. packwood 's and at least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it 
 i may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said sen. david boren d. okla. a leader of those democrats 
 the packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year 
 the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N after seven years 
 the packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by sen. william roth r. del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts 
 westmoreland coal co. <unk> benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results

 westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling <unk> coal in the <unk> region

 for example the chief executive himself now pays N N of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay N N 
 i think the ship is now <unk> the <unk> are pumped and we are on course mr. hutchinson said of the restructuring program 
 one difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer <unk> because of holidays and the hunting season

 this seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been <unk> disappointments 
 they are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label 
 for example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a <unk> sales commission 
 traditional <unk> made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't

 just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for warner bros. for which they had just produced the <unk> hit batman 
 but mr. guber figured that warner communications inc. chairman steven ross would <unk> and let the producers go knowing the sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work 
 sony promptly <unk> charging warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u.s. movie business 
 the accusations of lying and <unk> are flying thick and fast on both sides as one sony executive puts it it 's world war iii 
 their stock in trade as executive producers is <unk> out hot properties <unk> them up and then getting big studios to <unk> and distribute them 
 on that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script 
 and when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get mr. de <unk> adds 
 warner executives blame mr. guber 's and mr. peters 's lack of involvement in <unk> ii for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure 
 longtime hollywood associates describe mr. guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a <unk> for <unk> and marketing 
 peter is a major piece of hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says robert <unk> an agent at creative artists agency 
 mark johnson the producer of <unk> <unk> in he has a great ability to hire <unk> people and delegate authority 
 mr. peters on the other hand has fewer fans in hollywood and his <unk> like to <unk> him as something of a <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> married but now single mr. peters got plenty of ink last summer for an <unk> <unk> with actress kim <unk> during the making of batman 
 but for all their intellectual and <unk> differences they make the perfect good <unk> bad <unk> team hollywood associates say 
 producers don simpson and jerry <unk> who <unk> <unk> through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie <unk> when messrs. guber and peters take credit for the film 
 mr. peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and mr. guber are in with warner 
 still mr. <unk> says his relationship with guber peters was one of the most successful i 've had in hollywood 
 he says within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <unk> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <unk> <unk>

 some note that sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr. guber and letting mr. peters stay on to fulfill the warner contract 
 this business is n't about <unk> at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black

 the studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner 
 mr. guber replies that this is a <unk> this time warner trying to <unk> up two <unk> who have done only well for them for a long period of time 
 last may he sold his N N stake in <unk> to a passive australian investor and <unk> was renamed guber peters entertainment co 
 mr. guber and mr. peters claim they have an oral agreement with warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise 
 but in affidavits filed yesterday in the los angeles court mr. ross warner bros. chairman robert daly and president semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made 
 mr. daly in his affidavit acknowledges that warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over mgm but says that situation was altogether different 
 moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of guber peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it is now 
 warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let mr. guber and mr. peters go off to columbia 
 at the very least mr. ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of <unk> from sony 
 mr. guber and mr. peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the sony offer before taking it up with warner 
 the concept may be simple take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors 
 they warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate 
 moreover the securities were introduced only about N N years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession 
 a lot of this stuff really is in <unk> waters says owen <unk> director of the investment securities division of the u.s. comptroller of the currency 
 but wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market 
 we expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says bill <unk> a senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by wall street brokerage firms and offered to investors 
 issues typically come with credit <unk> such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings 
 enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions 
 that kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose <unk> depends on <unk> the money manager across the street 
 but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is <unk> 
 but if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance 
 moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level 
 he points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts 
 you could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a <unk> traded market says jonathan s. paris a vice president of european investors inc. a new york <unk> firm 
 in addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the new york stock exchange can simply check newspaper listings 
 investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is <unk> the securities 
 still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim 
 but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on <unk> paper 
 when you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties 
 but despite the credit <unk> despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could <unk> havoc on the underlying assets 
 at a time when americans are leveraged to their <unk> asset-backed investors may be taking a <unk> gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times 
 at the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the <unk> bonds they can find that is treasurys 
 that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter 
 in addition they fear that banks have been <unk> to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big <unk> who will default during a recession

 the poll conducted aug. N also provides a <unk> into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics 
 nearly half of the respondents N N said their investment portfolio was worth $ N or more and N N said it was worth $ N million or more 
 the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a <unk> more <unk> than they were a year ago 
 an additional N N of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next N months

 a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split <unk> displayed by americans in the voting <unk> 
 N republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a <unk> state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are democratic members of congress 
 if these assumptions hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic 
 third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office 
 because these <unk> placed far more emphasis on their <unk> role spreading the reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat 
 potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent 
 fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly <unk> in the south

 first economists james bennett and thomas <unk> find that gop senators turn back roughly N N more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do 
 to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow <unk> concerns 
 put more simply gop candidates for president are looked on more <unk> by voters than republican candidates for the senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe 
 moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same <unk> pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level 
 in sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly <unk> behavior voters display in the voting <unk> may have an <unk> rational explanation

 the coalition would include the current <unk> <unk> sen regime the two <unk> resistance groups led by son <unk> and prince <unk> and the khmer rouge 
 the aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of cambodia by allowing the khmer rouge a small share of power 
 the usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their <unk> and methods require they squeeze out everyone else 
 in <unk> when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination 
 even <unk> <unk> 's china began in N with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller <unk> parties

 but prince <unk> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by cambodia 
 for the u.s. to lend even the <unk> support to the most <unk> <unk> on <unk> 's bleak scene could only <unk> america 's allies elsewhere 
 at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents

 as former fed chairman william <unk> martin used to say they would have to take the <unk> bowl away just as the party is getting interesting 
 the fed is easily assigned the blame for <unk> like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the fed 's independence 
 but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view 
 the price level in the u.s. is now about N N times as high as it was N years ago 
 in each case the ending of this <unk> inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period

 the common proposals for <unk> the fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all 
 putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of governors one of the leading proposals today is an example 
 how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board 
 true a succession of fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury belongs on the fed 
 the fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more <unk> of the independence of the rest of the government 
 the fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more <unk> political part of the government 
 the greatest contribution congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system 
 people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true 
 and the fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level 
 the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed are high employment and rapid real growth

 thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones 
 with nearly N machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed mr. maynard boasts 
 he says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products 
 but he says that 's no more a reason for banning egg <unk> than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars 
 human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says jack <unk> chief of food protection for the new york state health department 
 the <unk> declines to comment but the group 's attorney alfred <unk> says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns 
 mr. maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at <unk> facilities regulated by the <unk> 's food safety inspection service 
 but the fda in a N letter to the united egg producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed 
 so the producers went to capitol hill where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban <unk> <unk> machines 
 mr. maynard whose company at the time was based in santa ana calif. <unk> his local congressman and the battle was joined 
 mr. maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the house of representatives to do it 
 even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs 
 so far new york new jersey nebraska georgia michigan and minnesota have outlawed mr. maynard 's device citing health concerns 
 an antitrust suit that mr. maynard 's company filed in los angeles federal court against the united egg producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes 
 the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr. maynard 's company to pay over $ N in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers 
 now he has moved to oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company <unk> inc. to market his machine

 however mr. <unk> directs his own material without <unk> and at its own <unk> pace baker boys is both <unk> and funny 
 of course it does n't hurt that mr. <unk> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing 
 though ms. pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic <unk> and to wear glamorous <unk> and <unk> heels the boys are pretty great too 
 what seemed like a good idea to cast the bridges brothers jeff and <unk> as the baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea

 the complex restructuring which was long expected <unk> london-based wcrs from primarily a <unk> of advertising into one of europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space 
 it also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by eurocom and headed jointly by new york ad man jerry della femina and two top wcrs executives 
 the merged agency 's <unk> ambitious goal to become one of the world 's N largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone 
 for eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong u.s. <unk> in della femina and more than <unk> the size of its ad agency business world-wide 
 meanwhile eurocom which had held N N of wcrs 's ad unit will pay # N million $ N million to raise its stake to N N 
 that price also covers eurocom raising to N N its N N stake in europe 's <unk> group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with wcrs 
 eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining N N of the merged ad agency group in six years 
 the transaction places the three executives <unk> at the helm of a major agency with the rather <unk> name of eurocom wcrs della femina ball ltd. or <unk> 
 both will report to tim <unk> a former wcrs executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency 
 the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in spain while mr. <unk> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <unk> germany and elsewhere 
 della femina had billings of just $ N million last year and ranked as the u.s. 's <unk> ad agency 
 the merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ N billion most of that in europe bringing it to about <unk> world-wide 
 to make it to <unk> status it would have to <unk> over such <unk> forces as grey advertising d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> and <unk> 's ddb needham 
 since then della femina won pan am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients including dow chemical co. 's <unk> wrap

 three of our favorite names mr. della femina calls that <unk> adding hopefully we 're a much more attractive agency to large <unk> today than we were yesterday 
 still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and <unk> firms that europe has seen 
 as part of the restructuring wcrs and eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across europe 
 what 's more both eurocom and brothers francis and <unk> gross who founded carat will acquire N N stakes in wcrs group creating a powerful link between eurocom and carat 
 mr. della femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative <unk> 
 they and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about $ N million 
 wcrs says its debt will be cut to # N million from # N million as a result of the transaction 
 by buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as N N which they can pass on to customers 
 they thus have won the french <unk> business of such advertising giants as coca-cola co. fiat s.p a. gillette and kodak 
 but now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing <unk> groups and carat wants to expand to the rest of europe

 one of the most remarkable features of the forced <unk> of the ethnic <unk> out of <unk> over the past five months has been the lack of international attention 
 the <unk> of more than N men women and children by the <unk> regime adds up to one of the largest <unk> seen in the postwar years 
 yet some people are advancing a <unk> <unk> that what we are seeing is somehow the <unk> result of the historical <unk> committed by the <unk> in the <unk> century 
 there can be no <unk> that the <unk> <unk> terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve 
 it puts great strain on a longstanding u.s. friendship with turkey a country that has been one of america 's strongest allies in nato 
 such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward turkey that surfaced when turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its <unk> emigration crisis 
 part of the problem some europeans have with turkey seems to stem from its location turkey is n't really part of europe 
 it 's when these <unk> fall on <unk> <unk> that the old <unk> of <unk> for treatment at the hands of the <unk> empire comes to the <unk>

 <unk> 's government has been <unk> beyond the pale for months and the u.s. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past 
 the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods

 natural <unk> and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also <unk> through which the state of a society can be <unk> 
 the rubble after the <unk> earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand 
 the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of san francisco is surely with the state of the u.s. economy 
 the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> era has produced <unk> <unk> about the present <unk> of u.s. economic and social arrangements 
 but we are in reality <unk> the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end 
 the financial equivalent of the sand used by those <unk> contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them 
 builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's <unk> necessary even to look the other way 
 government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in N at N N 
 in theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same 
 but of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits 
 by N the ratio was N N meaning that the market was <unk> every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at N cents 
 but here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe <unk> to look the other way 
 the profit rate is still low and the <unk> ratio was only N N in N and N N in N 
 but there were enough <unk> announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic <unk> for society to continue <unk> its eyes 
 the beneficiaries were those financiers whose <unk> was the topic figure of '80s capitalism michael <unk> 's $ N million salary in one year 
 profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow

 with airline deals in a tailspin legendary wall street trader michael steinhardt could have trouble <unk> out of usair group traders say 
 only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already <unk> down mr. steinhardt was engaged in a <unk> with usair 
 he was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated $ N million to build an N N usair stake for his investment clients 
 in fighting usair mr. steinhardt was <unk> against another investor <unk> warren buffett who bought into usair to help fend off mr. steinhardt 
 mr. buffett 's firm <unk> <unk> holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than mr. steinhardt 's firm steinhardt partners 
 it does n't make sense to <unk> out at this price mr. steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now <unk> usair managers ' operating skills 
 moreover unlike mr. buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years mr. steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing 
 so some see a special irony in the fact that mr. steinhardt the trader now is <unk> with a massive <unk> airline holding 
 as a result mr. steinhardt must <unk> himself to selling usair at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment 
 he does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an <unk> in the hole adds another steinhardt partners <unk> 
 if usair stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for mr. steinhardt to get out says timothy <unk> a merrill lynch analyst

 mr. icahn a much more practiced raider than mr. steinhardt eventually sold a big usair stake at a tiny profit through bear stearns 
 especially <unk> for mr. steinhardt say people close to him is that usair 's mr. <unk> wo n't even take his telephone calls 
 since last april the investor has made seven so-called <unk> filings in usair as he bought and sold the company 's stock 
 such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock 
 but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as steinhardt partners to take over a company 
 but meanwhile usair is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest <unk> airlines which it acquired 
 while he has bought and sold some usair shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding 
 mr. steinhardt adds that he bought usair stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group

 if the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date the put will probably expire <unk> 
 the investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit 
 once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar 
 when a stock falls below the put 's strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit 
 though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays 
 they can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks 
 as a result the <unk> insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline 
 in addition <unk> options were suspended from trading last friday afternoon after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the <unk> futures contract was halted

 a call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration 
 that 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call 
 but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away

 and surprisingly little more than a <unk> of protest is being heard even though <unk> once <unk> fire supporting the contras and the strategic defense initiative 
 though he <unk> supports both programs mr. bush has n't been a <unk> champion of either cause as mr. reagan was 
 what 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the bush administration lets the programs slip down the <unk> list 
 a combination of factors a <unk> among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a <unk> with other issues seem to explain the strange <unk> 
 mr. burton says conservatives ' <unk> with mr. bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make them more willing to speak out 
 mr. bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide <unk> aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february 
 the administration continues to support sdi or star wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program 
 and while the defense secretary is speaking out president bush himself has n't launched any <unk> campaign to drum up support as president reagan did 
 the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original vision of an <unk> shield protecting the whole u.s. but rather a more modest version 
 more <unk> to sdi supporters the bush administration appears to have <unk> accepted a new arms-control proposal from the soviet union that <unk> long-term trouble for star wars 
 it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty 
 but they say they ca n't make much <unk> because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide

 mr. allen <unk> to this <unk> because it seems to <unk> the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of <unk> 
 rights on such a basis whether for blacks or <unk> are mere <unk> he said subject to being taken back 
 he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups 
 his speech criticized the <unk> of <unk> of protected groups in society as opposed to individual <unk> or as he put it in a common <unk> as americans 
 the three most important things to understand about mr. allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment 
 he last made waves when he <unk> to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by <unk> parents off her <unk> 
 mr. allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow <unk> the vague concept of indian rights above the rights of individual indians 
 there is a huge divide between mr. allen 's <unk> view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups 
 we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as <unk> as mr. allen in making the case for <unk> of civil rights

 there are many reasons for the market 's <unk> new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options computer-driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology 
 but most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly 
 prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are <unk> ways to turn over shares at <unk> rates and increasingly acting in concert 
 institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an <unk>

 many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the N crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday

 a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman formerly head of arbitrage at goldman sachs & co

 after placing orders to sell mr. freeman called martin <unk> an investment banker at kidder peabody & co. who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors 
 mr. <unk> asked mr. freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was bunny <unk> responded well your bunny has a good nose 
 the illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market 
 yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here 
 but even if they behaved <unk> reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of <unk> judicial extension of the law of insider trading 
 still <unk> <unk> decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a <unk> on ad <unk> and usually <unk> examples

 first national bank of boston for example is offering certain new <unk> an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month cds 
 on average however three-month cds at major banks are yielding a <unk> of a percentage point less than they were a week ago 
 average yields on cds aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction 
 six-month cds of $ N and less yielded an average N N in the week ended tuesday down from N N according to banxquote

 mr. mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and <unk> cds but yields on cds aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent <unk>

 this would be consistent with its <unk> support for the brady plan and <unk> exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others 
 the size and pace of <unk> will accelerate further under the brady plan which promises larger and earlier <unk> to approved countries 
 first it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility 
 second the world bank 's recent $ N billion capital increase $ N billion from the u.s. has left the imf feeling less than first <unk> among international financial institutions

 they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in <unk> <unk> 
 they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up <unk> imf debt for <unk> commercial bank debt a bad trade all around 
 they point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into <unk> under <unk> imf programs 
 decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by congress 
 the last u.s. congressional authorization in N was a political <unk> and carried a $ N billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes 
 conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year 
 because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a <unk> imf mission would leave both feeling <unk> 
 furthermore a u.s. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to japan would give japan an argument against future calls for economic <unk> 
 on the other hand a decision to increase the imf 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of <unk> institutions in developing countries 
 with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate <unk> economic plans 
 <unk> the <unk> could slow economic development even further as countries delay <unk> steps in anticipation of richer <unk> support 
 the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose 
 if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative
